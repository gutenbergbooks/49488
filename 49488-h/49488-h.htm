<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In bidding farewell to this book before publication, I am most
anxious to thank with hearty sincerity all those who, as past or present
officers and friends of this historic regiment, have helped my efforts.
There are two names above all that I must most particularly record&mdash;(i.)
that of Colonel Coventry Williams, lately commanding the Greys,
who has helped in so many details, though I can only particularly refer
readers to pages <a href="#Page_291">291</a>, <a href="#Page_292">292</a> and <a href="#Page_293">293</a>. Colonel Williams is the half-brother
of Captain Williams, a portrait of whom, as he stands by his
charger, I have been able to include in this volume, and who, as named
by Kinglake (quoted on page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>), brought the Greys out of action at
Balaclava. There, too, Kinglake refers to the anonymous officer
whose Crimean recollections are given on pages <a href="#Page_80">80</a> to 84. That
officer has since died, and so, too, has Russell, the famous <cite>Times</cite>
correspondent, with whom he was exchanging affectionate greetings.
(ii.) In the next place I must record my gratitude to Major Lindsay,
who has shown the keen instinct native to the noble house of Crawford.
His grandfather opened his famous record with this quotation from
"Schir David Lyndesay of the Mont allias lyoun herauld king of
Armes":&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who that antique stories reads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider may the famous deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our nobil progenitours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which should to us be right mirrours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their virtuous deedis to ensue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vicious living to eschew."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The fact is that to hold the King's commission in the Royal Scots
Greys inspires a host of chivalrous thoughts and memories. Picture
the simple pride shown in the laconic words quoted on page <a href="#Page_293">293</a>,
"Greys, from your right number off ten!" and see pages <a href="#Page_52">52</a> to 74.
Here are letters from Francis Charlton Kinchant, who received his
commission on 18th January, 1815, and was killed at Waterloo. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
writing to a friend accounts describing how zealously he was learning
to practise the art of war, he goes on: "The regiment is without
doubt the best and the most crack cavalry corps in the service.
I don't think there is a private in it under 5 feet 11 inches." The
next personal allusion, describing the uniform of the corps, is to his
own father: "Our dress altogether is extremely rich and consequently
costs lots of money. The Court dress coat alone is 40 guineas. It is
covered with lace from head to foot. The jackets are handsome, but
they cost &pound;15. 15. each. Every other part of the equipment is equally
as expensive. In fact we make a most dashing appearance. I should
like much to meet the old Buck at Bath or Clifton. I do not think
he would know his hopeful son."</p>

<p>It is interesting to identify the noble Colonel James Gardiner,
killed at Preston Pans, as an officer in the Greys. Of course the
regiment has always held a peculiarly interesting position. For
instance, it does not join the ordinary rota for foreign service. It
shares with a very few the privilege of having a special honorary
Colonel-in-chief.</p>

<p>Before writing of Sir Thomas Dalyell, the first colonel of the
regiment, I wish to thank most cordially Mrs. Cornwall Dalyell of
The Binns, who most kindly allowed photographs to be taken of the
manuscripts of (and relics pertaining to) Sir Thomas Dalyell himself.</p>

<p>Thomas Dalyell or Dalzell, of Binns, was born about 1599, and
seems to have taken part in the Rochelle expedition in 1628, as captain
in the Earl of Morton's regiment. In 1640 he was serving under
Major Robert Monro at Aberdeen. He accompanied Monro in his
expedition to Ireland, 8th April, 1642, having obtained a commission
as colonel to command 2,500 men. On 6th May, 1651, he was
appointed by the King as General-Major of Foot, and fought at
Worcester on 3rd September. He was taken prisoner and committed
to the Tower, but escaped to the Continent. In March, 1654, he
appeared off the northern coasts of Scotland, and helped in the rebellion
in the Highlands in that year. Although a reward and free pardon
were offered to anyone who would give him up, dead or alive, he
again escaped to the Continent, and received from Charles a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
letter of thanks, dated Cologne, 30th December, 1654. On 19th July,
1666, he was appointed Commander-in-chief in Scotland. Captain
Crichton wrote of him: "He was bred up very hardy from his youth;
he never wore a peruke, nor did he shave his beard since the murder
of King Charles the First. He died on Sunday evening, 23rd August,
1685."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>In writing this record of the history of the Royal Scots Greys I
have aimed at giving scenes and characters as exactly as possible. I
have, therefore, used contemporary language without any modern
editing. The book will contain particulars relating to every officer
who has ever held a commission in the Regiment.</p>

<p>Before describing the origin of this famous Regiment, it will be
well to refer briefly to the title Dragoon. It will be noticed that in
the early official warrants, Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, are always three
distinct forces. The Dragoon was nearly allied to the Mounted
Infantryman, who, in modern times, has evoked such great public
interest. A captain was usually described as appointed to command,
not a troop, but a company.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland in 1672 a regiment
of Dragoons was raised; the pay was at a lower rate than the Horse,
and the men were armed as Infantry, except that a limited number
carried halberds instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets,
and a few in each troop had pistols.</p>

<p>The warrant, dated 2nd April, 1672, requires that the new force&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"shall be armed out of our stoares remaining within Our office of the Ordinance
as followeth; that is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the gentlemen at
armes, and twelve souldiers of each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case of pistolls with holsters; and the
rest of the souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are to have and to carry
each of them one matchlocke musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and also to
have and to carry one bayonet or great knife. That each lieutenant have and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
carry one partizan, and that two drums be delivered out for each Troope of the
said Regiment."</p></div>

<p>By warrants dated 21st May, 1678, two independent troops of
Dragoons were raised, their respective Captains being John Strachan
and John Inglis.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the Royal Scots Greys.</p>

<p>On 23rd September, 1678, Viscount Kingstoun was commissioned
to be Captain of "a new company of Dragoons appointed by us to be
forthwith levyed."</p>

<p>Four days later, Francis Stuart, of Coldingham, was appointed
Lieutenant of this new company.</p>

<p>On July 24th, 1679, Francis Stuart became Captain of this new
company in succession to Viscount Kingstoun who resigned.</p>

<p>By Royal Warrant on the 25th of November, 1681, three troops
were ordered to be added to the three already raised, and the whole six
formed into a regiment. See page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>.</p>

increase of forces there. (State Papers&mdash;Scotland&mdash;Warrant

by you here, of what has been done by you in our Service, Wee doe againe
approve of your proceeding, and thank you for your care, assuring you of our
favour, assistance, and protection, upon all occasions; and for the more effectual
prosecution thereof, wee find it necessary to signify to you, and by you to our
people there, that wee are firmly resolved to owne and assert our authority, so
as may equally encourage you and discourage all such as by seditious Practices
endeavour in aspersing you to lessen our Prerogative: And finding by good
information that the Phanaticks there, expecting encouragement from such as
oppose you, and taking advantage of the present juncture of affaires here, have
of late with great insolence flocked together frequently and openly in ffield
conventicles those Rendevouses of Rebellion, and haue dared to oppose our
fforces, though wee neither heed nor doe fear such insolent attempts, yet from a
just care of our own authority, and a kindnesse to our good subjects there, we
haue thought fit to order that some more fforces may be trained; and for that
effect wee haue commanded the Lords of our Treasury to take an effectuall
course for providing what money wee shall find necessary for raising and maintaining
those Troopes at our charge, And wee expect from you an exact and
speedy Account of what number and quality of Troopes may be necessary there
upon this occasion; to the end wee may direct commissions, and give such
other orders as wee shall find requisite. For doing whereof this shall be your
Warrant, and so wee bid you heartily ffarewell.</p>

<p>The next is of varied interest, giving the Duke of Monmouth
supreme command, and urging to be kept informed by "flying
packets." (Vol. v., page 156.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"Whitehall, 11th June, 1679, at Midnight.</p>

<p>"May it please your Lordship I am commanded by his Majesty to
acquaint you that in pursuance of his Resolution to send some Supplyes from
hence to you for suppressing the Rebellion now amongst the Phanaticks in the
West of Scotland, he hath ordered a Regiment of ffoote to be presently
embarqued to goe by Sea to Barwick together with cannon and ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sufficient, and his Majesty has ordered two Regiments of ffoote more to be
presently leauied, the one to be commanded by the Lord Cavendish and the
other by the Lord Gray of Wark, as also three Regiments of Horse under the
command of the Duke of Monmouth, Duke of Albemarle, the Lord Gerard,
Together with eight hundred Dragoons, There is likewise three troopes of
Granadiers, and these last are to march towards Scotland to-morrow. The King
has also thought fit to name the Duke of Monmouth Generall to command all
his fforces so long as his Grace shall remaine in Scotland. His Majesty by this
Expedition will be at the charge of upwards of five hundred pounds sterline a
day, which is more than &pound;150,000 sterline by year if they continue so long.
And seeing the King has so early provided for the preservation of his royall
government and your common safety, he has just reason to expect that in the
meantime you will bestow your utmost care and diligence as far as possible to
suppresse that vile Rebellion. His Majesty presseth much that frequent flying
packets may be sent at least every other day that he may know all things that
pass, and that they may bear large and exact accounts. All which by his
Majesty's command is signified to your Lordship by my Lord, your Lordships
most humble and most faithfull servant, <span class="smcap">Lauderdale</span>.</p>

Scotland. To be communicated to the remnant Lords and other of his
Majesty's most honourable Privy Councell of that Kingdome."</p></div>

<p>The next relates to the rebellion, and to the appointment of
"Thomas Dalzell to be Lieutenant General of all His Majesty's forces
in that his ancient kingdome." (Vol. v., folio 167.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"Whitehall, 19<sup>th</sup> June, 1679.</p>

<p>"May it please your Lordships. It was yesterday in the evening that
your Letter of y<sup>e</sup> 15<sup>th</sup> instant (by a flying Packett) came to my hand, and I did
immediately waite on the King with it, who after his reading it was pleased to
declare that he was very well satisfied with your recommending Generall Thomas
Dalzell to be Lieutenant Generall of all his Majesty's Forces in that his ancient
Kingdome, and gave me a command for Preparing his Commission for that
purpose; wherein I would lose no time, for it was ready this morning for his
Royall hand, and he was graciously pleased to signe it, as you have it now hereinclosed.
His Majesty is also exceedingly well pleased with the march of his
fforces last Munday against the Rebells, and with the extraordinary care and
diligence that have appeared in all your consultations and actions since the first
notice you had of the breaking out of this Rebellion, which he hopes (by the
blessing of God, and the continuance of your faithfull endeavours) will be soone
crushed. It was likewise a great satisfaction to his Majesty to know that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
were resolved to send fflying Packetts frequently for he has a very earnest
desire to be informed as often as possible, of the transactions there, during the
continuance of this Rebellion. Your Lordships may be pleased to send this
Letter to the Duke of Buccleugh, and this commission to the Lieutenant Generall
with all speed.</p>

<p>Folio 168 contains the Commission.</p>

<p>All the foregoing are from documents in the Record Office.</p>

<p>The next extracts are picked from the British Museum copy of a
rare autobiography, "The Memoirs of Captain John Crichton, written
by Himself." Printed in the year 1731. The peculiar interest of the
words that follow is that they were written wholly as the experiences
of one of the first officers of the Greys.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Francis Stuart, grandson to the Earl of Bothwell,
a private gentleman in the Horse-Guards, like myself, and my intimate
acquaintance, was sent for, in haste, by the General; because the
Council of Scotland was then writing to the King that his Majesty
would be pleased to grant commissions to those persons whose names
were to be sent up to London that very night. Mr. Stuart gave me
notice of this: whereupon, although I was not sent for, I resolved to
go up with him to Edenborough, and solicit for myself.</p>

<p>The General: "Wha' the Deel sent for you up?" I answered
that I hoped his Excellency would now make good his promise of
preferring me ... the General stood my firm friend, and although
the sons and brothers of Lords and Baronets and other persons of
quality solicited to be made Lieutenants and Cornets, in these new
raised Troops, yet the General in regard to my services, prevailed with
the Council that I might be appointed Lieutenant to Mr. Stuart, who
was then made Captain of Dragoons.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the Archbishop of St. Andrews was murdered by
the Laird of Hackston and Balfour, assisted by four poor weavers.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The Council finding the Rebels daily increasing in their
numbers ... his Majesty sent down the Duke of Monmouth ...
to be Commander-in-chief.... General Dalziel refused to serve under
him, and remained at his lodgings in Edenborough, till his Grace was
superseded, which happened about a fortnight after.... The General
Officers ... desired his Grace to let them know which way he
designed to take to come at the Enemy, the Duke answered, it must
be by Bothwell Bridge. Now the bridge lay a short mile to the
right of the King's Army, was narrow, and guarded with 3,000 of
the Rebels, and strongly barricaded with great stones; but although
the Officers were desirous to have passed the river, by easy fords,
directly between them and the Rebels and to march to their main
body on the moor, before those 3,000, who guarded the bridge, could
come to assist them; yet the Duke was obstinate, and would pass no
other way than that of the bridge. Pursuant to this preposterous and
absurd resolution, he commanded Captain Stuart (whose Lieutenant
I was) with his troop of Dragoons, and 80 Musqueteers, together with
four small Field-pieces, under cover of the Dragoons, to beat off the
party at the bridge. The Duke himself, with David Lesly and
Melvill, accompanyed us, and ordered the Field-pieces to be left at
the Village of Bothwell, within a musquet-shot of the bridge. When
the Duke and his men came near the bridge, the Rebels beat a parly,
and sent over a Laird, accompanied with a Kirk Preacher.... While
this Parly lasted, the Field-pieces were brought down and planted over
against the bridge, without being perceived by the Rebels. The
messengers ... they would not lay down their arms unless their
conditions were granted them; whereupon the Dragoons and Musqueteers
fired all at once upon those who guarded the bridge, and
the Field-pieces played so warmly, that some hundreds of the Rebels
were slain; the rest flying to the main body on the moor. The
Duke, as soon as he had commanded to fire, retired into a hollow
from the enemies' shot; ... and continued there till the action
was over. Then Captain Stuart ordered the Musqueteers to make
way for the Horse, to pass the bridge, by casting into the river the
stones which had been placed there to obstruct the passage over it;
but the army could not pass in less than five hours; and then marched
up in order of battle towards the enemy, who waited for them on the
moor, confiding in the superiority of their numbers. Clavers commanded
the Horse on the right, and Captain Stuart the Dragoons on
the left. The Field-pieces were carried in the centre of the Footguards,
while the rest of the Officers commanded at the head of their
men; and the Duke, after the enemy was beaten from the bridge, rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
at the head of the Army. Upon the first fire, the Rebel Horse turned
about.... Sir John Bell, Provost of Glasgow as soon as he saw the
Rebels fly, rode into the town; from whence, in a few hours, he sent
all the bread he could find, together with an hogshead of drink to each
troop and company in the Army, out of the cellars of such townsmen
as were found to be abettors or protectors of the Rebels.</p>

<p>The Pursuers were no sooner returned, and the whole action
over, than General Dalziel arrived at the camp from Edenborough,
with a commission renewed to be Commander-in-Chief, which he
received that very morning by an Express....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>On Saturday morning when the army was to march to Glasgow,
I desired the General's leave to go with twelve Dragoons in search of
some of the Rebels, who might probably pass the Clyde, about
Dunlatton, to shelter themselves in the Highlands. With these
Dragoons, clad in grey coats and bonnets, I made haste down the
side of the river; and about midnight, after travelling twenty-four
miles, I came to a church, and while the soldiers stayed to refresh
their horses in the churchyard, I spyed a country fellow going by, and
asked him in his own dialect, "Whither gang ye this time of night?"
He answered, "Wha are ye that speers?" I replied, "We are your
ane Foke." Upon this the fellow came up and told me; there were
18 friends with horses at an old Castle waiting for a boat to pass
over into the Isle of Arran. I mounted the man behind one of
my Dragoons, and went towards the place; but the Rebels not
finding a boat were gone off, and the guide dismissed. There was a
great dew on the grass, which directed me and my party to follow
the track of their horses for three or four miles, till the dew was
gone off; I then enquired of a cowherd on a hill whether he saw
any of our poor Foke travelling that way; he answered that they had
separated on that hill and gone three several ways, six in a party,
adding, that in one party there was a bra muckle kerl, with a white
hat on him, and a great bob of ribbons on the cock o't. Whereupon
I sent 4 of my Dragoons after one party, 4 more after another,
and myself with the remaining 4 went in pursuit of him with the
white hat.... The good man of the house returning from putting
the horses to grass in the garden was going to shut the door, whereupon
myself and one of the Dragoons commanded him, with our
pistols at his breast, to lead us to the room where the man lay who
wore a white hat. We entered the room, and before he awaked I
took away his arms, and commanded him to dress immediately; then
finding his companion asleep in the barn, I forced him likewise to
arise, and mounting them both on their own horses, came at 9
o'clock in the morning with my two prisoners to the other Dragoons
at the place where we appointed to meet. From thence we rode
strait to Glasgow, and arrived thither about 8 in the evening,
after a journey of 50 miles since we left the Army at Bothwell the
day before. The man with a white hat had turned out to be Master
John King.... About a month after I happened to dream that I
found one Wilson, a Captain among the Rebels at Bothwell Bridge,
in a bank of Wood upon the river Clyde. This accident made so
strong an impression upon my mind that as soon as I awaked I took
six-and-thirty Dragoons, and got to the place by break of day. Then
I caused some of them to alight and go into the wood and set him
up, as hounds do a hare, while the rest were ordered to stand sentry
to prevent his escape. It seems I dreamt fortunately, for Wilson was
actually in the wood with 5 more of his company, as we afterwards
learned, who all seeing me and my party advancing, hid themselves in
a little island on the river among the broom that grew upon it.
Wilson had not the good fortune to escape.... I seized and
brought him to my quarters, and from thence immediately conveyed
him to Edenborough, where he was hanged; but might have
preserved his life if he would have condescended only to say, God
save the King. This he utterly refused to do, and thereby lost not
only his life, but likewise an estate worth twenty-nine thousand marks
Scots. For this service, the Duke of Queensberry, then High Commissioner
of Scotland, recommended me to the King, who rewarded
me with the gift of Wilson's estate; but although the grant passed
the Seals, and the Sheriff put me in possession, yet I could neither
sell it nor let it, nobody daring, for fear of the Rebels who had
escaped at Bothwell Bridge, either to purchase or farm it, by which
means I never got a penny by the grant; and at the Revolution the
land was taken from me, and restored to Wilson's heirs....</p>

<p>"The winter following, General Dalziel, with a battalion of the
Earl of Linlithgow's Guards, the Earl of Airly's troop of Horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Captain Stuart's troop of Dragoons, quartered at Kilmarnock in the
west, 50 miles from Edenborough. Here the general one day,
happening to look on while I was exercising the troop of Dragoons,
asked me, when I had done, whether I knew any of my men who
was skilful in praying well in the style and tone of the Covenanters;
I immediately thought upon one James Gibb, who had been born in
Ireland, and whom I made a Dragoon. This man I brought to the
General, assuring his Excellency that if I had raked Hell, I could not
find his match for his skill in mimicking the Covenanters. Whereupon
the General gave him &pound;5 to buy him a gray coat and a bonnet,
and commanded him to find out the Rebels, but to be sure to
take care of himself among them. The Dragoon went 8 miles off
that very night, and got admittance into the house of a notorious
Rebel, pretending he came from Ireland out of zeal for the cause, to
assist at the fight of Bothwell Bridge, and could not find an opportunity
since of returning to Ireland with safety, he said he durst not
be seen in the day-time, and therefore after bewitching the family
with his gifts of praying, he was conveyed in the dusk of the next
evening, with a guide, to the house of the next adjoining Rebel; and
thus in the same manner, from one to another, till in a month's time
he got through the principal of them in the west, telling the General
at his return, that wherever he came he made the old wives in their
devout fits tear off their biggonets and mutches; he likewise gave
the General a list of their names and places of their abodes; and into
the bargain, brought back a good purse of money in his pocket. The
General desired to know how he had prayed amongst them; he
answered that it was his custom in his prayers to send the King, the
Ministers of State, the Officers of the Army, with all their soldiers,
and the Episcopall Clergy, all broadsides to Hell, but particularly the
General himself: "What," said the General, "did you send me to
Hell, Sir?" "<em>Yea</em>," replied the Dragoon, "you at the head of them,
as their leader....</p>

<p>"During the winter and the following spring I secured many
of those whose names and abodes the canting Dragoon had given
a list of.... In July following, the General, by order of Council,
commanded me to go with a detachment of 30 Horse and 50
Dragoons in pursuit of about 150 rebels who had escaped at Bothwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Bridge, and ever since kept together in a body up and down in
Galloway. I followed them for 5 or 6 days from one place to
another; after which, on 22nd of July, they stayed for me at Airs
Moss.... The Moss is 4 miles long from east to west and
2 broad. The Rebels drew up at the east end, and consisted of
30 Horse and 120 Foot. I faced them upon a rising ground with
my 30 Horse and 50 Dragoons. The reason why the Rebels chose
this place to fight on rather than a plain field was for fear their Horse
might desert the Foot, as they did on Hamilton Moor, near Bothwell
Bridge: and likewise, that in case they lost the day they might save
themselves by retreating into the Moss. I placed myself on the left,
as judging that the best officer the Rebels had would command on
the right. The action began about 5 in the afternoon, but lasted
not long; for I ordered my men first to receive the enemy's fire, then
to ride down the hill upon them and use their broad-swords. They
did so, and before the enemy had time to draw theirs, cut many of
them down in an instant. Whereupon they wheeled about, and
Captain Fowler, who commanded the Rebels on the right, being then
in the rear, advancing up to me, I gave him such a blow over the
head with my broad-sword as would have cleaved his scul had it not
been defended by a steel cap. Fowler turning about, aimed a blow
at me, but I warded it off, and with a back stroke cut the upper part
of his head clean off from the nose upwards. By this time the
Rebells, leaving their horses, fled to the Moss; but the Royalists
pursuing them killed about 60 and took 14 prisoners. Here Cameron,
the famous Covenanter, lost his life, and Haxton was taken prisoner,
infamous for embruing his hands in the blood of the Archbishop of
St. Andrews ... for which paricide both his hands were afterwards
cut off, and he was hanged at Edenborough. But this victory cost
me very dear, for being then in the rear I rode into the Moss after the
Rebels where I overtook a dozen of them hacking and hewing one
of my men whose horse was bogged; his name was Elliot, a stout
soldier and one of Claver's troop. He had received several wounds,
and was at the point of being killed when I came to his relief. I
shot one of the rogues dead with my carbine, which obliged the rest
to let the poor man and his horse creep out of the hole, but at the
same time drew all their fury upon myself; for Elliot made a shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to crawl out of the Moss leading his horse in his hands, but was
wholly disabled from assisting his deliverer, and was not regarded
by his enemies who probably thought he was mortally wounded,
or, indeed, rather that they had no time to mind him; for I laid
about me so fast that they judged it best to keep off and not
to venture within my reach, till it unfortunately happened that my
horse slipped into the same hole out of which Elliot and his horse
had just got. When they had me at this advantage they began to
show their courage and manfully dealt their blows with their broad-swords,
from some of which the carbine that hung down my back
defended me a little. As I was paddling in the hole, the horse not
able to get out, one of the rebels ran me through the small of the
back with his broad-sword, and at the same instant two more wounded
me under the ribs with their small ones. Then I threw myself over
the head of my horse, taking the far pistol out of the holster in my
left hand, and holding my broad-sword in my right; and as one of
the villains was coming hastily up to me his foot slipped, and before he
could recover himself I struck my sword into his skull; but the fellow,
being big and heavy, snapped it asunder as he fell within a span of the
hilt. The Rebels had me now at a great advantage. One of them
made a stroak at me which I guarded off with the hilt of the sword
that was left in my hand, but the force with which he struck the blow&mdash;and
I kept it off&mdash;brought us both to the ground. However I got
up before him, clapped my pistol to his side and shot him dead.
As soon as this was done another came behind me, and with some
weapon or other struck me such a blow on the head as laid me flat on
my back, in which posture I remained a good while insensible, the
rogues taking it for granted that I was dead, scoured off.</p>

<p>"A little recovering my senses, I strove to lift up my head, which
one of the rogues happening to see at some distance, immediately
returned, and said in my hearing: 'God, the dog is no deed yet.'
Then coming up to me, took his sword, and putting its hilt to his
breast and guiding it with both his hands, made a thrust at my belly;
but my senses were now so far recovered that I parried the thrust with
the piece of the sword which remained still in my hand. The fellow,
when he missed his aim, almost fell on his face, for the sword ran up
to the hilt in the moss; and as he was recovering himself I gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a dab in the mouth with my broken sword which very much hurt
him, but he aiming a second thrust, which I had likewise the good
fortune to put by, and having as before given him another dab in
the mouth, he immediately went off for fear of the pursuers, whereof
many were now returning. In this distress I made a shift, with much
difficulty and pain, to get upon my feet, but my right leg being
disabled by the wound I received from the broad-sword, I was forced
to limp by the help of the carbine, which I made use of as a staff.
I had lost my horse, for one of the rogues, when I had quitted him in
the hole, led him away through the Moss. I recovered him about a
year after from the man to whom the rebel had sold him."</p>

<p>This next letter, from the King, taken from the Record Office,
refers to the three Independent Troops of Dragoons, and orders three
more Troops to be levied, and the whole six to be then <em>regimented</em>,

<p>"My dear and most entirely beloved Brother. Wee greet you well. Wee
have thought fit for the good of our Service to retrench all the Companyes of
ffoote of our Regiment of Guard commanded by the Earle of Linlithgow, and
likewise all the companies of the Regiment of ffoote commanded by the Earle of
Mar, as also to retrench every one of the three Companies of Dragoons now
standing. Therefore you are to give order to Generall Thomas Dalyell, our
Lieutenant Generall, to reduce and disband six men out of every Company of the
above mentioned two Regiments of ffoote (and this ouer and aboue any former
Retrenchment made by us as to the ffoote) and forty-five Dragoones of every
one of the three Companies of Dragoones aboue mentioned, together with one
Corporall of Dragoones out of every one of the said three Companies, and that
this Retrenchment be made upon the last day of November instant, and that
these Souldiers ffoote and Dragoones so disbanded receive pay till that day
inclusive. Wee have likewise thought it necessary for our Service that three
Companies of Dragoones be presently leavied, each Company consisting of fifty
souldiers, centinell Standers (besides the officers' servants allowed by our Establishment),
and wee appoint each Company to haue two Sergeants, two Corporalls
and two Drummers, besides the officers commissioned by us. <em>Wee haue likewise
resolved that the three Companies of Dragoones already standing so reduced
with those three to be Leavied shalbe Regimented</em>; and to that affect wee have
commissioned our said <em>Lieutenant Generall to be Colonel thereof, Lord Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Murray to be Lieutenant Colonell and Sir James Turner to be Major;</em> and that
each of them have one Company in that Regiment. You are therefore to give
order to our Lieutenant Generall to cause these Companies to be leauied
accordingly, and to bring them as soon as can be to a Muster; at and after
which Muster they are to enter into Pay conforme to our establishment. For
doing of all which this shalbe your Warrant, and so Wee bid you heartily
farewell. Given at our Court at Whitehall the 25 day of November 1681, and

<p>John Creichton, of the Massacre of Glencoe, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"McDonnal, Laird of Cappagh, in the Highlands, ... was unjustly
possessed, as most men believed, for many years, of an estate, which in right
belonged to the Laird of Mackintosh.... Soon after, the Government
ordered me to detach 60 Dragoons, with a Lieutenant, Cornet, and Standard,
and to march with Captain Streighton, and 200 of the Foot Guards against the
McDonnels.... Whereupon we, who were sent against him, continued to
destroy all the houses and corn, from the time of Lammas to the 10th of
September; and then we advanced towards the Borders, to join the Scotch
army, at that time marching towards England, against the Prince of Orange,
then intending an invasion."</p></div>

<p>[Creichton now goes on with his account of the coming of
William the Third, which is, of course, a mistake in order.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We arrived thither October 1st, after a march of 200 miles.... The
army did not reach London till about 25th October.... The Earl of Airly,
when he was Lord Ogleby, had attended the great Marquess of Montrose in all
his Actions, for King Charles the First and Second. But at this time being
old, it was reported that he was dead, before the Scotch Forces went into
England, to oppose the Prince of Orange; whereupon the King had given his
troop in Dundee's Regiment to the Earl of Anandale: but the Earl having
overtook the Army at Cambridge, in their march, went on to London, and
there presenting himself before the King; his Majesty ... immediately
restored his Lordship to his Troop, ordering him at the same time to command
those 200 men who attended him down to Salisbury. When all the Forces
were arrived at Salisbury, the Earl of Dunmore, with his Regiment of Dragoons,
wherein I served, was ordered to a Pass 3 miles below the City, where I
commanded the Guard that night.</p>

<p>"I now return to my Lord Dundee, and my Lord Dunmore. Their
Lordships acted no longer as Colonels, when they understood that the Prince
intended to place himself on the throne during his Majesty's life.... After
their Lordships were gone to Scotland, I went to Watford, where my Lord
Kilsythe, as Lieutenant Colonel, commanded the Lord Dunmore's Regiment of
Dragoons.... Major General McCoy ordered the Lord Kilsythe to march
the Regiment from place to place till they should come to Congerton, a town in
Cheshire. Here they quartered, when the Prince and Princess of Orange were
proclaimed King and Queen of England, &amp;c., by the Sheriff and 3 or 4 Bailiffs.
It happened to be a very stormy day; and when the Sheriff had done his Office,
a crack-brained fellow, at the head of a great rabble, proclaimed the Duke of
Monmouth king, to the great diversion of the Regiment; not believing he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
been beheaded. When my Lord Dunmore refused to serve the Prince of
Orange, Sir Thomas Levingston, of my Lord Kilsythe's family, got the
Regiment. This gentleman was born in Holland, and often used to raise
recruits in Scotland; upon which account he was well known to the Regiment.
He came down, Post, to Congerton, and at Supper, told the officers that he was
sent to know, which of them would serve King William and which would not?
Now the oath of allegiance to that Prince, having not been offered to that
Regiment, one of the Company answered that we having sworn Allegiance to
King James, could not, in conscience and honour, draw our swords against
him: Whereupon Sir Thomas, drinking an health to King James, upon his
knees, answered that he wished he might be damned, whenever he should
command them to break that oath: and in order to ingratiate himself further
with the Regiment, added: that he would return to London next day, for a
command to march them strait to Scotland, where their wives and friends were;
and likewise to procure a Captain's commission for me, since Sir Adam Blair,
who commanded the troop, in which I was Lieutenant, had refused to serve
King William, both which he accordingly obtained. When he returned from
London, he marched with the Regiment, directly through Berwick, into Scotland.</p>

<p>"From this period, my troubles began; for I was then sent up to Edenborough,
and there imprisoned in the Tolbooth, together with my Lord
Kilsythe, Captain Levingston, Captain Murray, and Lieutenant Murray, each of
us in a separate dungeon; with orders that none should be permitted to speak
with us, except through the keyhole; and in this miserable condition we lay
for two months.... The Council, although they could force no confession
from me, or my companions, that might affect my Lord Kilsythe, on whose
estate their hearts were much set, yet resolved to make a sacrifice of someone
among us ... the lot fell on me.... Lord Dundee, then at Blair Castle
in Athole, hearing this, wrote to the Council&mdash;that if they hanged Captain
Creichton, he would cut the Laird of Blair, and the Laird of Pollock, joint by
joint, and would send their limbs in hampers to the Council."</p></div>

<p>On 31st May, 1694, the Regiment landed at Williamstadt, in
North Brabant, and on June 16th was reviewed by King William before
occupying cantonments near Arschot. No general engagement took
place this year: but the Regiment was twice engaged in skirmishes with
the French cavalry, and in October marched into cantonments in the
villages near Ghent. Coming out of winter quarters in April, 1695,
the Regiment proceeded to Dixmude, in West Flanders, and thence
to join the Army encamped at Arseele, and on 31st May were
reviewed by King William with the rest of the Army. During the
progress of the siege of Namur the Regiment formed part of the
Army under the Prince of Vaudemont which man&#339;uvred so as to
protect the troops employed before the town. The Regiment was
encamped a short time between Genappe and Waterloo; it afterwards
occupied, together with the Regiment of Foot of Holstein-Ploen,
an important post at Masy, and after the surrender of the citadel
of Namur marched into winter quarters in West Flanders.</p>

<p>In May, 1696, they encamped near Bruges and for some months
were stationed behind the canal between Ghent and Bruges, their
duty being to observe the motions of the French Army commanded
by Marshal Villeroy, which was encamped on the opposite side of
the canal. In October they marched into winter quarters in the
villages behind Bruges. In the spring of 1697 negotiations were
opened for a general peace. They were encamped for a short time
between Brussels and Aeth, afterwards between Vilvorde and Burntbridge,
on the Brussels canal; and when the peace of Ryswick was
concluded they marched to Bruges. Before the end of December
the Regiment embarked for England and landing at Harwich early
in January, 1698, marched at once to Scotland. The establishment
which, during the war, had been 8 troops and 590 officers and men
was ordered to be reduced to 6 troops and 294 officers and men.</p>

<p>In 1701 the accession of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of
Spain caused war to be declared again on May 15th. The two troops
were again added, and early in 1702 the Regiment embarked for
Holland.</p>

<p>The Regiment formed part of the guard for the English artillery
train at Breda, with which it joined the allied army under John
Churchill, Earl of Marlborough.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1702 the Greys were engaged in covering
the sieges of Venloo, Ruremonde and Stevenswaert. The following
is taken from those most interesting records, Marlborough's own
correspondence and despatches:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sutendal, 21st September, 1702. The castle of Venloo was carried by
storm last Monday, so that they hope to be masters of the town by Sunday or
Monday. My Lord Cutts commanded at one of the breaches, and the English
grenadiers had the honour of being the first that entered the fort. We are
making all preparations we can for the attack of Ruremond and Stevenswaert,
and I think no other enemy but ill weather can hinder us from taking them.</p>

<p>2 October. Our batteries began to play upon Stevenswaert on
Saturday last, and continued firing without intermission till about 10 last night,
when, the besieged having abandoned the counterscarp, and our men being ready
to mount the breach, they beat the chamade, and desired to capitulate.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<p>9 October. On Saturday at 3 in the morning, his Excellency the Earl
of Marlborough received an express from Ruremond, that our batteries having
begun to play upon the town on Friday morning, about 6 the same evening the
besieged had desired to capitulate. The garrison, consisting of near 2000 men,
are to march out this day, and to be conducted, with two pieces of cannon, to
Antwerp. We found in the place 30 pieces of cannon....</p></div>

<p>The Regiment was also present at the taking of Liege, on
October 23rd. Before going into winter quarters one squadron acted
as a body-guard to Marlborough in visiting Venloo and Ruremonde.
The Regiment wintered in Dutch Brabant. Before the end of
April, 1703, the Regiment took the field again and encamped near
Hamont, in the province of Limburg, from whence they marched
to Lardner Heath, afterwards to Ch&acirc;teau D'Horn, near Ruremonde,
and on May 7th they reached near to Tongres. In the meanwhile a
party of English cavalry, escorting a quantity of specie for the
Army, was attacked and defeated by a detachment of French troops,
who captured the treasure. The Greys were instantly ordered
out, and dashing across the country intercepted and defeated the
French troops and returned with the specie in triumph back to
camp.</p>

<p>Next the Regiment was sent towards Bonn, then being besieged.
After the taking of Bonn it joined the main army near Maestricht
on May 21st.</p>

<p>The Regiment was engaged in the siege of Limburg, which
fell on September 28th.</p>

<p>When the famous campaign of 1704 opened Lord John Hay,
son of the Marquis of Tweeddale, became, by purchase, Colonel in
succession to Viscount Teviot.</p>

<p>During the operations under Marlborough on the Dutch frontiers
a body of French troops passed the Black Forest and, joining
the Bavarians, gained several advantages over the Austrians,
endangering the Imperial throne.</p>

<p>In April, 1704, the Greys, joined by a remount from Scotland,
marched to Bedburgh on the Lower Rhine, where they were reviewed
by Marlborough, and on May 19th began its march on that
important expedition. To keep the enemy in suspense, the troops
proceeded towards the Moselle, but on the 25th May changed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
route, and marched to Coblentz. Having crossed the Rhine and the
Moselle, Marlborough pushed forward in advance with the cavalry
for the Danube, ordering the infantry to follow. Continuing their
march through the States of Germany, the regiments crossed the
Necker in the early part of June, while the rapidity of their movements
and the secrecy of their design filled all Europe with wonder
and anxiety, and the enemy appeared confused and lost in doubt
and conjecture.</p>

<p>The British Regiments joined the forces of the Emperor, commanded
by the Margrave of Baden, when the new line of battle was
formed and the brigade, consisting of the Royal Scots and Royal
Irish Dragoons, was posted on the left of the first line. Marlborough
wishing to possess Donawerth as a place of arms, decided to attack
a division commanded by the Count D'Arco, posted on the lofty
heights of Schellenberg, on the north of the Danube commanding the
passage of that river at Donawerth, and the Greys formed part of the
force chosen for this service. After marching, on July 2nd, through
a country intersected with rivulets and other obstacles the troops came
near to Schellenberg. At 6 in the evening the attack was ordered,
and the British infantry going forward with firm and resolute step
assaulted the entrenchments, while the Greys and other cavalry moved
forward in support. In a few moments a storm of bullets assailed
the ranks of the Bavarians, and the thunder of the British fire echoed
in the valley below. The post was valiantly defended, and a fierce
fight had gone on for some time when the Greys were ordered to
dismount, form as infantry, and assault the trenches. The regiment
instantly obeyed, and led by its gallant Colonel, Lord John Hay,
advanced boldly to the attack and mixed fiercely in the conflict. At
this instant the enemy gave way on all sides, and the cavalry rushing
forward sabred many as they fled towards the Danube; whilst the
Count D'Arco, and other officers escaped by crossing the river.</p>

<p>The post won and the enemy's baggage, artillery, and many
standards captured, the Royal Scots Dragoons remounted. The Regiment
lost in the action Captain Douglas and 7 men killed, two
officers, and 17 men wounded. Donawerth was occupied on the
following day.</p>

<p>The next great event to refer to is the Battle of Blenheim, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
valley of the Danube, fought on August 13th. The following words
are Sir Edward Creasy's:&mdash;"Like Hannibal, Marlborough relied
principally on his cavalry for achieving his decisive successes, and it
was by his cavalry that Blenheim, the greatest of his victories, was
won. The battle had lasted till five in the afternoon. Marlborough
had now 8,000 horsemen drawn up in two lines, and in
the most perfect order for a general attack on the enemy's line along
the space between Blenheim and Oberglau. The infantry was drawn
up in battalions in their rear, so as to support them if repulsed and to
keep in check the large masses of the French that still occupied the
village of Blenheim.</p>

<p>"Tallard now interlaced his squadrons of cavalry with battalions
of infantry, and Marlborough, by a corresponding movement, brought
several regiments of infantry and some pieces of artillery to his front
line at intervals between the bodies of horse. A little after 5 Marlborough
commenced the decisive movement, and the allied cavalry,
strengthened and supported by foot and guns, advanced slowly from
the lower ground near the Nebel up the slope to where the French
cavalry, 10,000 strong, awaited them. On riding over the summit of
the acclivity the allies were received with so hot a fire from the French
artillery and small arms that at first the cavalry recoiled, but without
abandoning the high ground. The guns and the infantry, which they
had brought with them, maintained the contest with spirit and
effect. The French fire seemed to slacken; Marlborough instantly
ordered a charge along the line. The allied cavalry galloped
forward at the enemy's squadrons, and the hearts of the French
horsemen failed them. Discharging their carbines at an idle distance
they wheeled round and spurred from the field, leaving the nine
infantry battalions of their comrades to be ridden down by the torrent
of the allied cavalry."</p>

<p>The Greys lost several men and horses wounded but none
killed.</p>

<p>Extracts from a journal of the 1704 campaign kept by Mr. Hare,
chaplain to the Duke, and afterwards Bishop of Chichester:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Being thus resolved to attack the enemy, they gave orders that the Army
should march before break of day, and range itself in order of battle upon the
plain, between Grenhiern and Orklau. The whole army as it was now

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

(Brigadier Baldwyn and several other parties not being yet come in) consisted
of 66 Battalions and 160 Squadrons on the right wing, under Prince Eugene,
there were the seven Danish and eleven Prussian Battalions, which were all the
Foot his Highness had under his command; he had also 74 Squadrons composed
of the Imperial and Prussian Troops, with those of Swabia, Franconia,
Wurtemberg, and other Troops of the Empire.</p>

<p>"On the left wing against Marshal Tallard were 48 Battalions (viz.) 14
English, 14 Dutch, 7 Hessian, and 13 of Hanover, Luxembourg, Zell, and
Swiss; also 86 Squadrons (viz.) 14 English, 22 Danes, and 18 Dutch, 7
Hessian, and 25 of Lunenbourg, Hanover, and Zell. This Army marched
directly towards the enemies (which were then about 4 miles distant) before
break of day in the following order.</p>

<p>"The Imperial Army filed off to the right in 4 columns (viz.) two of
Infantry and two of Cavalry. The Infantry marched to the right of the Cavalry
upon a rising ground, close by a wood which came down to the River Kessel
before mentioned. The two lines of Cavalry marched to the left of them; the
English and Dutch army filed off also in 4 such Columns, having on their right
the 2 Columns of the Imperial Cavalry, and on their left the villages of
Dapsheim, Schwening and the Danube. Major General Wilkies and Brigadier
Rowe, with 9 Battalions that were left in Dapsheim, to maintain that post all
the last night, now marched to the left of all by themselves, next the Danube.
The Imperial Artillery followed the Infantry of that wing, and the English and
Dutch artillery and Pontoons marched through the villages of Erlinghoffen,
Dapsheim and Schweingen; and all the baggage was sent back to Rittingen
near Donawert, where it was to be drawn up till further orders.</p>

<p>"His Grace caused the whole Army to halt, and then detached 11
Battalions out of both lines of the left wing to be joined to the 9 already
detached under Major General Wilkie near the Danube. The whole twenty
were to be commanded by the Lord Cutts, and under him Major General
Wilkies and St. Paul, and Brigadier Ferguson, Rowe and Hulson. Major
General Wood and Brigadier General Ross were ordered with 15 squadrons of
Dragoons to sustain the Lord Cutts. These Battalions and squadrons being
joined with the other nine, made a ninth column which marched upon the left
of all, by itself, next the Danube, the Lord Cutts being ordered with this
detachment to attack the village of Blenheim, which joined to that River.</p>

<p>"This being done the Army moved forwards, His Grace and Prince Eugene
advancing before all, with some squadrons of the Grand Guard to take a view of
the enemy; they discovered their advanced parties before 6 in the morning,
which parties as our squadrons came up retired by degrees into their camp. About
7 our Generals stood and took a full view of the enemies' camp upon a rising
ground over against Overklau, on our side the Rivulet; it continues to run in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
two Branches till within a few paces before it falls into the Danube, the meadows
between them being soft and marshy. One of the Branches had two mills
upon it, at both which there was an easy passage over the Rivulet.</p>

<p>"His Grace saw all this very plainly at half-a-mile distance, but he was
more particularly informed of the nature of this ground by Major General
Nazemere, of the King of Prussia's troops, who had been wounded the year before
in the defeat of Count Styrum by the Elector of Bavaria and Monsieur Dupon
upon the very place. All this while, the morning being a little hazy, the enemy
might think we had only little parties abroad and not know that our whole Army
was in motion. However it was they lay quiet in their camp, and two deserters
from them gave his Grace a particular account how their troops were encampt.</p>

<p>"Our Columns began to appear a little after 7 in the morning, both officers
and soldiers advancing very cheerfully and shewing a firm and glad countenance
and persuading themselves of a victorious day.</p>

<p>"All this while the village of Blenheim had been incessantly attacked
by the Lord Cutts, who having found it impracticable to enter that place sword
in hand, as the enemy were posted, had altered his method and attacked with
his fire only. The first of his lines (which was posted near the enemy's
entrenchments) continually discharged in Platoons, and the other lines relieved
this and each other successively.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding all which it held out still, and now gave work to all
our Infantry. For the moment that our Cavalry had beaten that of the enemy
and cleared the field of them, General Churchill marched both the lines of
Foot and laid them upon this village in two different places, so that it was now
quite surrounded and there was no getting out of it but through the Danube,
and to prevent their escaping that way the Queen's Regiment (commanded by
Brigadier Webb) took possession of a little Barrier the enemy had made to
cover their retreat and was posted to the right of all fronting to the street
which led down to the Danube. By this means several hundreds of the enemy
endeavouring to get of that way were made Prisoners by that Regiment which
besides this service, has the consideration due to it, that the Horses belonging
to the dismounted Regiments of French Dragoons were at their Piquets close
by this Regiment, yet there was not a man stirred out of his rank to take one
of them but they all fell a booty to other soldiers. Prince George's Regiment
(commanded by Colonel Byton) was posted next the Danube to the left, on the
other side of the Town; so that all those of the enemy which came out that
way were either taken prisoners, killed, or forced into the Danube; some of
them endeavoured to break out in two other places of the village, <em>but Major-General
Wood (who was left with only the Lord John Hayes's Regiment of
Grey Dragoons)</em> perceiving it immediately advanced towards them, and
taking the advantage of a rising ground, amused them, and made them believe
he had more squadrons behind him and so drew up and stopped them there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brigadier Ross (who was ordered to sustain Lieutenant-General Ingoldsby)
did the like on the other side of the Town with 5 squadrons of Dragoons and
3 squadrons of Horse which Lieutenant-General Lumley had sent from the
pursuit for this purpose; two of which he soon after sent back again, upon
order he had received from the Duke of Marlborough to bring all the squadrons
he could to the right, where the Elector was marching off.</p>

<p>"It was now betwixt 3 and 4 o'clock when General Churchill sent word
to the Lord Cutts that the Duke of Marlborough had beaten the enemies
Horse out of the field. He also let him know that he himself was going to
attack the same village in Flank and Rear, and therefore desired his Lordship
to make another attack at the same time in the front, if his troops were not
too much spent, or at least to make a feint of doing it. This was effectually
executed at once on all sides. The Earl of Orkney and Lieutenant-General
Ingoldsby entered the village at two different places at the Head of their respective
Lines, but not being able to make a front equal to what the enemy had in
the village, especially in the Churchyard which had high walls round about it,
they were forced to retire. However this, and the frequent attacks the enemy
had sustained in their front for several hours together; the damage they suffered
by our Cannon which played all the afternoon furiously upon them within
musket shot, the great disorder they were put into by a Battery of Howitzers,
whose shells set all the Barns and Houses on fire, and especially Monsieur
Clerambaut their commander being fled and as they were told, drowned in the
Danube, and being quite surrounded, and obliged to stand another attack at a
time when they had no hopes of relief, the Cavalry which was to sustain them,
being drove quite out of the Field: all these together put them into so great
consternation, that they demanded a cessation, which being allowed, General
Churchill sent orders to the Lord Cutts to cease attacking in the Front, and
the Lord Orkney immediately sent in Captain Abercromby his Aid du Camp
on one side as Lieutenant-General Ingoldsby did Lieutenant-Colonel Belville
of the Tell regiment of de Beial on the other side. After a very little time
their Lieutenant-Colonel returned with Monsieur Hautefeuille and Monsieur
Blansac, and the Lieutenant-Colonel's own Brother, who was Captain in Nasseys
Regiment of Dragoons, then dismounted in the Town. The Lord Orkney had
also met with the Marquis Desnouville, who commanded the French regiment
Royal and was already made prisoner, but was suffered to go into the Town
again, upon his parole to return immediately. This he did bringing with him
to the Lord Orkney several French generals. And as they were all capitulating,
General Churchill came up and told the French Generals that he had no time
to lose, (it being now past 7 in the evening), and that if they did not lay down
their arms immediately he would renew the attack, upon this they thought fit to
submit, and they, with all their regiments, were made Prisoners at discretion."</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>The campaign of 1704 closed with the Siege of Landau, the
Greys forming part of the army covering the siege. In September,
when the King of the Romans visited the British camp, the Duke of
Marlborough placed himself at the head of the "Royal Scots
Dragoons" to receive his Majesty.</p>

<p>The interesting incident is thus entered by Hare in his Journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On 2nd of October the King of the Romans came from before Landau,
to take a view of the Army commanded by his Grace at Weissembourg. His
Grace sent Colonel Cadogan to conduct His Majesty to the left of the Army
which was drawn out in two lines for this purpose. His Grace there received
and saluted His Majesty at the head of Lord John Hayes' regiment of
Dragoons, and afterwards accompanied His Majesty along the lines, which
appeared extremely fine and gave great satisfaction to his Majesty."</p></div>

<p>In November they marched back to Holland for the winter, and
in Guelderland were joined by another remount from Scotland.</p>

<p>They were withdrawn from their cantonments early in May
of 1705, and after traversing Limburg, encamped near the banks of
the river Maese, where the Duke of Marlborough assembled the army
for the purpose of proceeding up the Moselle. After a halt of two
days, the cavalry crossed the Maese, and marched to Coblenz, and
thence to Juliers. After leaving this, they crossed a barren country
to Triersweiler, where the troops encamped on May 26th. Thence
the Moselle and the Saar were crossed, and plans made for offensive
warfare. This was all frustrated by Austrian delays and German
commanders' jealousies. The Duke of Marlborough resolved therefore
to return.</p>

<p>At midnight on June 17th the troops decamped in the midst of
a heavy rain, and the Royal Scots Dragoons, with several other
regiments, formed up to cover the retreat through a long and narrow
defile. No enemy, however, appeared to interrupt the army, and
retracing their former steps by forced marches, the Greys reached the
vicinity of Maestricht on June 30th; when the French forces in the
Netherlands instantly ceased acting on the offensive, and took refuge
behind their lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>After several changes of position, the Greys and other corps were
ordered to be ready to march immediately after dark on the evening
of July 17th; and the regiment was formed on this occasion as usual
in brigade with the Royal Irish Dragoons under the command of
Brigadier-General Lord John Hay. The French lines to be taken
were very formidable, for besides the height of the rampart, and the
largeness of the ditch, they were further defended by the difficulties of
the ground over which they were to be approached; and by the
river Geet, which could not be crossed without laying bridges over it,
and which was near enough to the lines to be defended by the fire
from the parapet. Our troops continued their march throughout the
night, which was extremely dark, and at four in the morning surprised
the French guards and took the position. Scarcely had the Greys
and Irish Dragoons, with a few squadrons of horse, passed the lines,
when the Marquis d'Allegre appeared with twenty battalions of
infantry and fifty squadrons of cavalry. The Duke of Marlborough
led his horse and dragoons forward, and by an impetuous charge,
broke the enemy's ranks. A short but fiery conflict followed with
varied success, and the Greys displayed their usual spirit. Finally the
enemy's squadrons were dispersed, their standards and kettledrums were
captured, and many officers and men were taken prisoners. The
enemy's infantry also suffered severely; a few battalions however
retired in a square in admirable order.</p>

<p>The campaign closed, and the Scots Greys marched to Dutch
Brabant, where they spent the winter.</p>

<p>From the archives of the Regiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Early in 1705 the sheriff (<em>i.e.</em>, Sir James Agnew) parted with his eldest
son (Andrew), who at seventeen joined the army in Flanders as a volunteer.
Pleased at the idea of the boy's winning his own spurs, he supplied him with a
moderately well-filled purse, while his mother, along with her blessing, furnished
him with an introduction to the Duke of Marlborough, as well as other letters
of introduction. Thus furnished, the youth embarked, and reached the camp
in February in safety, where he attached himself to the 'Royal Grey Dragoons.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
At the mess of this distinguished corps he met many friends from Galloway.
His brother-in-law, Colonel Agnew, was Major, whose brother Thomas was
also a Captain in the regiment; and among the subs. were the young Laird of
Mochrun, George Dunbar, as well as John Dunbar, his youngest brother.
Within a few weeks of his arrival he received, to his no small gratification, a
commission signed by the Duke of Marlborough in camp at Rastad on the
11th of May, 1705, appointing Andrew Agnew to be cornet of that troop in
Her Majesty's Royal Regiment of Scotts Dragoons, commanded by the Right
Honourable John Hay, whereof Major Andrew Agnew is Captain."</p></div>

<p>Then come three pages of the adventures of the Greys in the
campaign in which the said Andrew took his part. He was afterwards
the famous Sir Andrew who fought in the Rebellion of 1745, and
specially noted for his defence of Blair Castle at that time.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the Duke of Argyle had arrived in Scotland about the middle
of September, and hastened to the camp at Stirling. He had brought with him
not a single battalion of troops, not one piece of artillery. He had found
under his command no more than 1,000 foot, and a body of Dragoons, partly
from that excellent regiment the Scots Greys, but altogether of only 500 men."</p></div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his note on Sinclair's MS., page 304,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons called the Scots Greys, for many years maintained a
character greatly superior to that of an ordinary regiment. They never gave a
bounty exceeding a crown, and were recruited from a class of persons greatly
superior to those who usually enter the army, such as the sons of decent farmers
and tradesmen, who felt a vocation for the army. No ignominious punishment
was ever inflicted, and a criminal who had merited such was previously
transferred to another regiment."</p></div>

<p>Early in May, 1706, they left their winter quarters, and after
crossing the plains of Limburg and the rich valleys of Liege, they on
May 20th joined the army encamped at Bilsen, and afterwards
marched to Borchloen. On May 23rd a detachment of the Greys,
and several squadrons of horse, were ordered to march towards Mont
St. Andr&eacute;, and were soon after followed by the army in eight columns.
There was a thick fog, but the cavalry pushed on until they gained
the heights near Mierdorp, when through the misty dawn they espied
a few of the enemy's cavalry crossing the plains of St. Andr&eacute;, and soon
the fog lifting, the French army was discovered in position at
Ramillies. Advancing into the plains of Tandrin&#339;uil, the Allies
prepared for action, the Queen's Horse, the Greys, and the Royal
Irish Dragoons, with Churchill's and Mordaunt's regiments of
infantry, being posted on the heights of Foulz on the right of the
line. About 1&middot;30 in the afternoon the Allies began heavy artillery
fire, which was quickly answered by the enemy, and the action
became general. For some time the troops on the heights on the
right were only spectators, but Marlborough, seeing that an attack
made by the Dutch and Danish cavalry on the French Household
regiments, Gens D'Armes, Gardes du Corps, and others, was not
succeeding, ordered his right wing to advance. Churchill's and
Mordaunt's regiments descended first, and meeting three battalions of
French infantry, drove them into a morass, where most of them were
killed or captured. At the same time the Queen's Horse, the Greys,
and the Irish Dragoons galloped through the morass, crossed the high
ground beyond it, and attacking the enemy's left, routed the French
cavalry, and cut several battalions of infantry to pieces. The Greys
charged into the village of Autreglize, overthrew and sabred the
infantry in the streets. Coming out of the village, they encountered
the famous French regiment du Roi, which at once surrendered and
delivered up its colours and arms to the victorious Dragoons.</p>

<p>The contemporary account in the "London Gazette" was as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The horse of their left wing seemed to make a stand to gain time for
their foot to retire, but were charged so quickly and with so much bravery by
the English, that they entirely abandoned the foot, and our Dragoons pushing
into the village of Autreglize, made a terrible slaughter. The French King's
Own regiment of foot called the regiment du Roi, begged for quarter, and
delivered up their arms and colours to Lord John Hay's Dragoons (the
Greys)."</p></div>

<p>In connection with the battle of Ramillies, some account must
be given of a woman, Christian Davies, or Mother Ross, who served
as a trooper in the Greys until, fighting at Ramillies, her skull was
fractured, and her sex afterwards discovered.</p>

<p>In 1740 appeared a book of nearly 200 pages, purporting to
record her life and adventures; also in 1893 she was included in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
volume called "Women Adventurers," published by T. Fisher Unwin.
The account of her given in the D. N. B. seems excellent. Presumably
she was brave, but she seems to have been a very coarse
woman. Born in Dublin in 1667, she married Richard Welsh. He,
without her knowledge, was in some way forced to enlist in a foot
regiment, and wrote letters to his wife which never reached her. At
last she heard of his being in the army, and so disguised herself as a
soldier to go in search of him.</p>

<p>She enlisted in Captain Tichborne's company of foot as
Christopher Welch. In a skirmish before the battle of Landen she
was wounded, and in the next year&mdash;1694&mdash;taken prisoner by the
French, but exchanged.</p>

<p>At her own wish she was now allowed to join the Greys, and
continued so until after the peace of Ryswick. On the renewal of
war in 1701 she went back to Holland and re-enlisted in the Greys.
She fought at Niuwegen, Venloo, Bonn, and in most of the engagements
of the campaign, till at the battle of Donauwerth she received
a ball in the hip, which caused a temporary retirement into hospital.
The ball was never extracted, but Christian was again under arms
in time to share in the spoil after Blenheim. While forming one of a
guard to some prisoners taken in that battle, she again saw her
husband after a separation of thirteen years. She lost no time in
revealing her identity to him; but so enamoured was she of camp
life that she extracted a promise from Welsh that he would pass
himself off as her brother. After Ramillies she, of course, had to
cease to be a trooper, but she still continued to live in camp, and
accompanied her husband as his acknowledged wife. In 1709
Richard Welsh was killed at Malplaquet. Christian herself found
his body, and her lamentations were so extravagant as to excite the
open commiseration of a Captain Ross, whence it is said she gained
the sobriquet of Mother Ross, by which she was known for the rest
of her days. Although grieving so that for a whole week she refused
to touch food, she married Hugh Jones, a grenadier, within three
months. In 1710 Jones was killed at the siege of Saint-Venant. In
1712 she returned to England, was presented to Queen Anne, and
awarded a life pension of a shilling a day. She afterwards went to
Dublin and married a soldier named Davies. She died on July 7th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
1739, and, at her own request, her body was interred among the
pensioners in Chelsea burying ground, and three grand volleys were
fired over her grave.</p>

<p>After this great victory at Ramillies, on Whit Sunday, May 23rd,
1705, the Greys were occupied in covering the successful sieges of
several fortified towns in Flanders, and in the autumn the British
troops went into quarters in Flanders, excepting the Royal Scots
Greys and Irish Dragoons, who proceeded to Holland.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1707 the Greys went to Spanish Brabant,
and encamped near the banks of the little river Sienne. In this year
the Acts of Parliament were passed for the Union of the crowns of
England and Scotland, and from that time the Greys were designated
"The Royal Regiment of North British Dragoons."</p>

<p>The army was assembled at Brussels, and afterwards encamped
near Weldert. The year passed off very quietly; but Richard
Cannon found some record of a sharp fight between twenty-five
troopers of the Greys sent out to cut forage and thirty French
musketeers, the result alleged being fourteen Frenchmen killed and
the rest taken.</p>

<p>On July 11th, 1708, the Greys were engaged in the important
battle of Oudenarde, and this battle, with the story of the events
preceding it, is full of interest, but would be out of place in this
record of one particular regiment.</p>

<p>After this the Regiment formed part of the covering army, and
was employed in escorting provisions and ammunition to the troops
laying siege to Lisle, the capital of French Flanders. After Lisle
had fallen to the Allies, the Greys were sent into winter quarters
in Flanders. The winter proved extremely severe, and a considerable
number of men and horses are said to have been frozen to
death.</p>

<p>In 1709 the Greys formed part of the troops covering the siege
and fall of Tournay; but the event of the year was the battle of
Malplaquet, fought on September 11th, 1709. The Greys were
brigaded with the Royal Irish Dragoons, under Brigadier-General
Sybourg. They were posted near the centre of the Allied Army to
sustain the attacks of the infantry and protect the artillery, and for
some time were only spectators of the fierce storm of battle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
raged on all sides; at length, however, they were ordered to file
through a wood in their front, and charge. Scarcely had the brigade
emerged from among the trees before it encountered a line of French
cavalry; these squadrons were, however, soon dispersed, but they
were instantly succeeded by a new line of champions, consisting of a
number of squadrons of the French household cavalry, clad in armour,
and advancing in firm array. Richard Cannon has described how the
Greys and Irish Dragoons met these foaming squadrons with signal
bravery, but were driven from their ground by superior numbers.
The two regiments soon rallied, and being joined by several corps of
horse, returned to the charge; yet such was the resolution displayed
by the French troopers that it was not until the third charge that they
were driven from the field. The two victorious regiments were
specially thanked by the Duke of Marlborough. The Greys lost
about thirty killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards employed in covering the siege of
Mons, the capital of Hainault, and after the surrender of Mons
marched into winter quarters at the little town of Tiel.</p>

<p>Malplaquet was a desperately hard-fought battle. Not for the
first or last time in our history, an important battle was nearly lost
through the imbecile action of the authorities at home in failing to
support an able general abroad.</p>

<p>In Coxe's "Marlborough," large paper edition, Vol. III., page 90,
we find the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In considering the consequences of this eventful day, we cannot but
applaud the foresight of Marlborough, who before the opening of the campaign
had so earnestly pressed for a powerful augmentation of troops. He was
conscious that the French were prepared to make their final effort in the
Netherlands, and that he should have to contend with a far greater force than
he had yet encountered. The battle proved that his calculations were well
founded, and that an additional number of 10,000 men on that eventful day
would have more contributed to the advancement of peace, than all the efforts
of the ablest negotiators in Europe. The Allies, indeed, remained masters of
the field; but the laurels of their two great commanders were deeply tinged
with blood, and the result of the campaign was far from being commensurate
with the sacrifice of so many valuable lives."</p></div>

<p>Of the springing valour displayed by the enemy on the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Malplaquet there can be no question, and a distinguished French
officer wrote to a correspondent at the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Eugenes and Marlboroughs ought to be well satisfied with us
during that day; since till then they had not met with resistance worthy of them.
They may say, with justice, that nothing can stand before them; and, indeed,
what shall be able to stem the rapid course of these two heroes, if an army of
100,000 of the best troops, posted between two woods trebly entrenched,
and performing their duty as well as any brave men could do, were not able to
stop them for one day? Will you not then own with me, that they surpass all
the heroes of former ages?"</p></div>

<p>Early in 1710 the regiment was joined by a remount of 100 men
and horses from Scotland, and marching from its cantonments,
encamped on high ground near Tournay. In the afternoon of
April 20th it was again on the march, and formed part of the First
Division of the Allied Army which forced the enemy's fortified lines at
Pont-&agrave;-Vendin on the 21st, and encamped at night on the plain of
Lens; and afterwards helping in covering the siege of Douay, a strong
town on the river Scarpe, and finally was stationed at Pont-&agrave;-Nache.
While here, the Duke of Marlborough, by special commission from
Queen Anne, invested its Colonel&mdash;the Earl of Stair&mdash;with the Order
of the Thistle.</p>

<p>On May 10th the enemy made a sudden sally from Fort
Scarpe to take the bread waggons going to the Allies; but
reaching Pont-&agrave;-Nache, their career was suddenly stopped by a
squadron of the Greys, and two squadrons of the Royal Irish
Dragoons, who came sweeping up the plain at full gallop, and
routing the enemy in an instant, chased them with heavy loss
under the cannon of the fort. Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell, of the
Royal Irish Dragoons, who commanded the three squadrons, was
wounded in the pursuit.</p>

<p>After the fall of Douay, the Greys crossed the country of Artois
to the banks of the river Bietres; and encamped before Bethune,
which was at once besieged. They were subsequently occupied in
escorting military stores up the country, and after the taking of
Bethune, they were occupied with the sieges of Aire and Saint-Venant.
The surrender of Aire ended the campaign.</p>

<p>Early in May, 1711, the army assembled in French Flanders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
encamped, first at Warde, and next on the plain of Lens. After
man&#339;uvring skilfully, Marlborough succeeded in forcing the enemy's
lines by the causeway at Arleux, crossed the Scheldt, and besieged
Bouchain. In all this the Greys took part. After the fall of
Bouchain, the army retired into winter quarters.</p>

<p>In 1712 the French sued for peace, and the Greys marched from
the frontiers of Picardy into Flanders, staying there until the signing
of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. They then returned to England
at the close of eleven years of hard war service.</p>

<p>A satisfactory change now took place in the official status of the
Greys. In 1694, when many English, Irish, and Scots regiments
were serving in the Netherlands, King William commanded a board of
general officers to assemble and decide upon the rank of the several
corps. This board gave precedence to the English regiments, and the
Scots and Irish were only allowed to take rank in the English army
from the date of their first arrival in England, or from the date when
they were first placed on the English establishment. There being
three regiments of English Dragoons raised previous to 1688, when
the Royal Scots Dragoons were first placed upon the English
establishment, this regiment consequently obtained rank as Fourth
Dragoons only.</p>

<p>But in 1713, when Queen Anne had ordered another board of
general officers to assemble to decide upon the rank of several
newly-raised regiments, proof was adduced that the Royal Scots
Dragoon crossed the Border and entered England in June, 1685,
when there was only one regiment of Dragoons on the English
establishment.</p>

<p>This was taken into consideration, and after some delay the Scots
Greys obtained the rank of Second Dragoons.</p>

<p>Regiments were not, however, distinguished by numerical titles
before the reign of George the Second.</p>

<p>In 1713 the regiment was increased to nine troops.</p>

<p>The Greys were next occupied in quelling the Rebellion of the
Old Pretender, and here they won special distinction.</p>

<p>In 1719 the Jacobites, aided by Spain, made another attempt on
Scotland, but were routed on June 10th at Strachell. Three troops of
the Greys under Major Robinson were engaged.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>In April, 1721, reduced on account of peace to 207 men,
the regiment left Scotland, and was placed in cantonments in
the northern counties of England. In 1723 it returned to Scotland,
and in 1725 marched into quarters in Nottinghamshire and
Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Early in 1727 the Regiment was again increased to nine troops,
and it was ordered to be ready for foreign service, but no embarkation
took place. The nine troops were marched into quarters near
Hounslow, and on October 28th were reviewed on the heath by King
George the Second. They afterwards marched into quarters in
Yorkshire, where the three augmentation troops were reduced, and the
numbers of the establishment of the Regiment fixed at 309 officers
and men.</p>

<p>In 1730 the Regiment was again in Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1737 it came back to England, and was chiefly busy on the
Kentish coast suppressing smugglers.</p>

<p>In April, 1738, the regiment marched into Dorset and Wilts, to
suppress popular riots.</p>

<p>In September, 1739, the Regiment was increased to 435 officers
and men. Richard Cannon pictures the regiment spending the
following summer encamped among the ancient oaks in Windsor
Forest. In October it marched into Yorkshire, but soon came south
again and was quartered in Berkshire.</p>

<p>Charles the Sixth, Emperor of Germany, died in 1740, and
England was a party to the Pragmatic Sanction by which the crown
was guaranteed to his daughter Maria Theresa as Queen of Hungary
and Bohemia.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Elector of Bavaria, as descendant of
Ferdinand the First, claimed these countries, and was supported by
the French King, Louis the Fourteenth.</p>

<p>On June 19th, 1742, the Greys were reviewed by King George
the Second on Kew Green, and three days later marched for Dover.
A publication called "The Champion" records:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On Tuesday, General Campbell's fine regiment of Scots Greys arrived in
the Borough of Southwark on their march to Dover, where they are to embark
for Flanders. They are fine hardy fellows, and want no seasoning, and made an
appearance agreeable to all but the innkeepers."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>For the two great campaigns that now followed I copy from the
archives preserved by the Regiment a</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Note from the British Military Library or Journal,

<p>"This regiment frequently distinguished itself in the wars of King William
and Queen Anne, and in many actions by its own individual prowess might
justly be said to have inclined the balance in favour of the British arms, nor
was it less active in the Rebellion of 1715.</p>

<p>"In the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, the cool, intrepid and invincible
courage of this corps was eminently conspicuous.</p>

<p>"In the battle of Dettingen, the French were commanded by the celebrated
Marshal de Noailles, and the Allied Army by his late Majesty King George the
Second and the great Duke of Cumberland. The French had nearly effected
the utter ruin of the Allies, by surrounding them, in order to cut off all
supplies, in which case the whole must have been reduced to the disagreeable
necessity of surrendering at the mercy of the enemy, nor could anything short
of the most unexampled heroism rescue them from the impending danger&mdash;that
heroism was not wanting. The combined troops, animated by the presence
and example of the King and Prince, little regarded the enemy's vast superiority
of numbers, while the Earl of Stair made a vigorous charge with the cavalry,
among whom were the Scots Greys, then under the command of Sir James
Campbell, an officer of high talents in his profession, and who signalised himself
on this occasion in a manner which proved him truly worthy the command.
Unfortunately for his country and the service this meritorious officer fell by a
cannon shot the succeeding year, at the battle of Fontenoy in 1744.</p>

<p>"In this battle, fought on the 30th of April, than which few have been
more bloody, the laurel was snatched from the enemy by this corps and three
others, who covered the British and Hanoverian Infantry, under General Lord
Ligonier, and that in so gallant a manner as to render wholly abortive one of
the greatest objects of the French commander, for the timid Dutch had retreated,
leaving a wing of the Allied Army exposed to the enemy, and this, although
supported by two British battalions.</p>

<p>"The hazard was great and the moment more critical inasmuch as its brave
Colonel was killed and his post left defective for a considerable time until
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland ordered some pieces of cannon
to be brought up, at the head of the Foot Guards, which soon silenced the
enemy's guns, and by exciting universal admiration at the General's presence of
mind in the midst of such danger, the troops were roused to unusual exertions
and actually took possession of some of their batteries, although, to effect this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
they were necessarily exposed to a most terrible and incessant cannonade.
Perhaps the page of history could not produce a parallel to the bravery of the
British troops in this engagement, who, after having stood for upwards of
three hours the incessant fire of three strong batteries, could drive the French,
their superiors in point of number, from their lines into their Camp; who when
thinned in their ranks, tired with slaughter and almost sinking beneath their
wounds, could break the same host of troops, drive them back a second time,
and at length make good a safe retreat, at the moment when the enemy was
reinforced by seven fresh battalions."</p></div>

<p>At the risk of seeming lengthy, I must here add, without pretending
to edit it, a paragraph from Cannon's very scarce record:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A tremendous cannonade was followed by volleys of musketry and
charges of cavalry. The Greys supported the infantry for some time; but at
length they were led forward by their Colonel, the chivalrous and daring
Lieutenant-General James Campbell, against a line of French Cuirassiers.
Their grey horses and grenadier caps rendered them conspicuous&mdash;their noble
bearing excited admiration. Before them appeared the enemy's squadrons,
formidable in numbers, and bright in polished armour; but undismayed by the
opposing ranks of war, the Greys raised a loud huzza, and rushed at speed upon
their steel-clad opponents, who were overthrown and pursued to the rear of their
own lines....</p>

<p>"The Greys pursued their adversaries to the banks of the river, and
captured a White Standard, with which they returned in triumph to their own
lines, where they received the expression of the approbation of their Sovereign,
who had witnessed their gallantry.... The standard was of white damask,
finely embroidered with gold and silver; a thunderbolt in the middle, upon a
blue and white ground; motto, <em lang="la">Sensere Gigantes</em>."</p></div>

<p>The following interesting 1747 record I copy from the Manuscript
Papers now preserved by the Greys:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Extract from the Record Book of the Enniskilling Dragoons.</p>

<p class="right">"Signed, <span class="smcap">E. M. W. Gres</span>, Major.</p>

<p>"1747. The Duke of Cumberland arrived at the Hague on the 15th of
February. The French made some hostile movements in April. The Allied Army
were encamped near to Antwerp, their right extending to Breschater. The army
of the Allies marched 30th of June in three columns towards Lonaken, and
encamped between that place and Ghenck. The French corps of the Count de
Clermont occupied the high ground from Tongress to Tonggrebech. His
Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland and Marshal Bathiani resolved to
take possession of the camp of Bilsen. On the 2nd of July an action was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
fought between Tongress and Bilsen, near Maestricht, called the battle of Keselt
or of Lafeldt, or Vol. The British cavalry charged and broke the enemy's first
line, and afterwards when His Royal Highness was with them, charged a second
time and broke the enemy again; hereupon the enemy made a desperate effort
on the centre of the Allies; their squadrons penetrated and divided the army.</p>

<p>"At this juncture the British cavalry, led on by Sir John Ligonier, charged
the French with so much success that they overthrew all before them, but too
eager in pursuit of the enemy, received a sharp fire from the Foot, which
they had posted in a hollow way and some hedges, to favour the flight of their
horse, by which they suffered a good deal; they dispersed, however, that Foot
and some fresh squadrons which the enemy had sent down upon them, but
was all in vain whilst the army was divided in two.</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness, therefore, called the Cavalry off and sent word to
the Marshal that he should retire towards Maestricht, and would move towards
Velt Wesel and Lanaken to favour his Retreat. This done, he retired the left
wing slowly and in good order, bringing off all the heavy field artillery. His
Royal Highness gave the greatest commendation to His Majesty's British and
Electoral troops, of which there was not a squadron or Battalion which did not
charge and beat the enemy more than once. The Scots Greys, the Duke's,
Rothe's, the 6th Inniskilling, and Sir Robert Rich's Dragoons, gave the
French cavalry a prodigious overthrow and took several standards.</p>

<p>"The Brigade of Scotch and Irish in the French service fought desperately,
and would have taken the Duke of Cumberland prisoner, had not Sir John
Ligonier come up with a party of cavalry and thereby saved His Royal
Highness.</p>

<p>"The Allies took five standards and seven pair of Colours. In this Battle
the Regiment suffered severely. The allies passed to the eastern side of the
Meuse immediately after the Battle of 2nd of July. Encamped at Gronfelt.
The French laid siege to Bergen Op Zoom:</p>

<p>"Several sallies and skirmishes. In August the Allies moved nearer to
Liege. The French had their left towards Tongress and their right towards
Liege.</p>

<p>"Bergen Op Zoom taken by the French 16th September.</p>

<p>"In October the troops went into winter quarters on the Dutch Frontier
in the neighbourhood of Breda.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Cumberland and General Ligonier arrived in England 13th
November.</p>

<p>"20th November five regiments of Foot embarked at Gravesend for
Flanders."</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed on October 7th, 1748,
and the Greys returned to England, and were stationed at Leicester,
Coventry, and Warwick. By the usual mean and miserable policy, or
want of any policy, the Regiment was at once reduced to 285 officers
and men! (In time of peace, always take care not to be prepared for
war.) In December, 1749, the Regiment went into quarters in Kent,
and was employed on revenue duty on the coast. In 1750 they were
in Sussex and Devon, and in 1751 in Dorsetshire. The Regiment
marched into Lancashire in the spring of 1753; with detached
troops in Somersetshire, where it was stationed during the following
year; and in the spring of 1755 proceeded to Northampton and other
towns in that part of the kingdom. Complications now coming to a
point about British and French possessions in North America, the
Regiment's establishment was made up to 357 of all ranks, and very
soon a light troop was added, in the same way as light companies had
been added to regiments of infantry.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1755 the Greys occupied quarters in Herefordshire
and in the winter months were dispersed in cantonments in
Kent. In the next spring they marched into Surrey, and afterwards
into Dorsetshire, and in June encamped with several other corps near
Blandford.</p>

<p>In April, 1757, they went into cantonments in Essex, staying
there four months, and then going into Suffolk. In October four
troops proceeded to Newmarket.</p>

<p>An expedition was now made ready for a descent on the coast of
France, and the "light troop," commanded by Captain Francis
Lindsay, was ordered on this service.</p>

<p>The following is from the "Weekly Journal," 23 May, 1758:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The nine troops of Hussars (Light Dragoons) belonging to the nine regiments
of cavalry, are now preparing to go upon this expedition. The flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of these Hussars is the troop commanded by Captain Lindsay, quartered at
Maidenhead, where they have been practising the Prussian exercise, and for
some days have been digging large trenches and leaping over them, also leaping
high hedges with broad ditches on the other side. Their Captain on Saturday
last, swam with his horse over the Thames and back again; and the whole
troop were yesterday to swim the river."</p></div>

<p>On June 5th, 1758, the Brigade landed on the coast of France
about nine miles from St. Malo, and on the 7th set fire to the shipping
in St. Malo.</p>

<p>The troops having succeeded in this, now came home again.</p>

<p>In August the Greys light troop formed part of another
expedition which captured Cherbourg. After returning to England
the light troop was quartered in towns on the coast of Sussex.</p>

<p>The Greys were among the troops sent to Germany under the
command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the year 1758, at
which time the Duke of Argyle commanded the Regiment. These
troops landed at Embden on the 20th of July and were headed by
the Duke of Marlborough and the Lord George Sackville.</p>

<p>Still did their gallantry and good conduct preserve to them
the high opinion which the Regiment had so justly merited in
every conflict to which its squadrons were exposed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hague</span>, Septr. 1st.</p>

<p>"By the last letters from Prince Ferdinand's Army, which are of the 28th
past, we have received information that the French under Marshall Broglio, left
their camp upon the Dymel in the night between the 21st and 22nd, marching
off by their right, and that the Hereditary Prince crossed that river on the 22nd
at the head of 12,000 men, in order to gain the left flank of the enemy.
That the advanced troops of that corps came up with their rearguard near
Zierenberg; and that, after the light troops on each side had been engaged with
different success, the Hereditary Prince arrived in person with the Greys and
Iniskilling Dragoons, supported by the English Grenadiers, and put an end to
the affair in a quarter of an hour, by forcing the enemy to a precipitate flight
with great loss."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<p class="center">The "London Gazette," Saturday, September 13th, to Tuesday,
September 16th, 1760.
</p>

<p class="right">"Prince Ferdinand's Head Quarters at Buhne, Sept. 9.</p>

<p>"On the 5th past, a very considerable body of the enemy, amounting to
20,000 men and upwards, attempted to make a general forage in the neighbourhood
of Geismar; But Prince Ferdinand, having received previous intelligence
of their design, crossed the Dymel early in the morning of that day, and went
in person with a corps of troops to oppose them; and though His Serene
Highness was much inferior in number to the French, yet he took his
precautions so well, by occupying some advantageous heights, and placing
artillery there, that he rendered the enemy's attempt totally ineffectual, notwithstanding
a large portion of their Army was in motion to cover the foragers.</p>

<p>"On the morning of that day likewise, the Hereditary Prince (upon
intelligence that the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphin&eacute;, consisting each, when
compleat, of 600 Horse and 600 foot, were cantoned at Zierenberg; and, from
the very small distance of the French camp at Dierenberg, thought themselves in
perfect security) went from his camp at Warbourg to Maltzberg, which is not
much more than a league from Zierenberg, without seeing any of their Posts,
or meeting any of their Patroles. This made His Serene Highness resolve on
an attempt to surprise them; for which purpose he ordered five Battalions, a
Detachment of 150 Highlanders under the command of Captain McLeon, and
eight squadrons of Dragoons to be ready to march at eight at night.</p>

<p>"They left their tents standing, and passed the Dymel near Warbourg;
Maxwell's Battalion of Grenadiers, the Detachment of Highlanders, and Kingsley's
Regiment, forming the Head of the Column. These were followed by two other
Battalions of Grenadiers and by Block's Regiment. The eight squadrons of
Dragoons were Block's, the Greys, and Iniskillings. At the village of Witzen,
about a league on the other side of the Dymel, we found all the light troops,
which were under Major Bulow's command, and whose destination was to turn
the town of Zierenberg, and to take post between it and Durenberg, in order
to intercept whoever should attempt passing to the enemy's Camp. At the
entrance of a large wood, near Maltzberg, the Greys and Iniskillings were
posted. At Maltzberg, a Battalion of Grenadiers. The other Battalion of
Grenadiers, the regiment of Block, and Block's Dragoons, were posted at proper
distances between Maltzberg and Zierenberg to cover us, in case we had been
repulsed and pursued. At a mill, about two English miles from the town and
within sight of the fires of the enemy's grand guards, Maxwell's Grenadiers
took one Road, Kingsley's Regiment and the Detachment of Highlanders
another. When we came within less than half a mile of the Town the
vedettes of their grand guards challenged us, but did not push forward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
reconnoitre us. Our men marched in the most profound silence. In a few
minutes we saw the fires of their piquets, which they had posted close to the
Town. The noise of our trampling over gardens gave them the alarm, and
they began to fire; upon which our Grenadiers, who had marched with unloaded
firelocks (as had been agreed on), ran on towards the town, pushed the Piquets,
and having killed the guard at the gate, rushed into the Town, and drove
everything before them. Never was a more compleat surprize. The attack was
so sudden, that the enemy had not time to get together in any numbers, but
began to fire at us from the windows; upon which our men rushed into the
houses, and for some time made a severe use of their Bayonets. They afterwards
loaded and killed a great many of the enemy, who had mounted their
horses. It was about two in the morning when we got into the Town, and
about three the Prince ordered the Retreat, after we had taken M. de Norman,
Brigadier, who commanded the volunteers of Dauphin&eacute;, and M. de Comeiras,
Colonel of those of Clermont, with about 40 more officers and 300 private
men. The number of killed and wounded is very considerable, from an
ill-judged resistance of those who were in the houses; but in justice to our
men, it must be said that they gave quarter to all who asked it; and there are
several noble instances of their refusing to take money from their prisoners,
who offered them their purses. General Griffin, who went into the Town at the
head of Kingsley's Regiment, received a thrust in the breast with a Bayonet (as
it is supposed from one of our own people) upon hearing him talk French to a
soldier whom he had seized, and who would not quit his firelock, but the
wound is a very slight one. What makes this affair the more satisfactory is
that it has not cost us ten men, which is wonderful in a night attack, where we
might have expected to have lost more by our own mistaking friends for foes.</p>

<p>"The behaviour of the Officers and the bravery of the Troops upon this
occasion deserve the greatest commendation. Lord George Lennox was a
volunteer in this expedition, and had his horse wounded under him by a shot
from a window. With our prisoners we brought off two pieces of cannon, and
had we had time to search the houses the number of our prisoners would have
been doubled; but as day was coming on, and we might have been cut off from
Warburg, we returned the same way we came, and arrived there at eight in the
morning of the 6th without being at all molested."</p></div>

<p>In 1763 a treaty of peace was signed, and as early as February,
1763, the Greys quitted Germany, and marching through Holland,
embarked at Williamstadt in North Brabant, landed at Gravesend, and
proceeded to Hereford. Soon the light troop, which had remained
in England, was disbanded, but 8 men per troop were now equipped
as Light Dragoons. The establishment was reduced to 213 men!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
In November the Regiment marched to Scotland, and were stationed
at Dalkeith and Musselburgh; but soon returned South, and in
1764 were stationed at Manchester and Warrington. In April, 1765,
they marched to Worcester and Pershore. In 1766 they went to
Sussex.</p>

<p>At this date "Drummers," who had been on the establishment
from the foundation of the Corps, were ordered to be replaced by
"Trumpeters."</p>

<p>In May, 1767, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, and in
the winter of 1768 it was in winter cantonments in Lincoln and
Boston.</p>

<p>In 1769 they went to Scotland, returning the next year to
Warwick, Lichfield and Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p>The greater part of 1771 was spent in cantonments in Dorsetshire
and Somersetshire. In 1772 the Regiment was stationed at
Canterbury, with detachments on coast duty in Kent. In May,
1773, it marched into quarters at Greenwich and the neighbouring
villages; and on May 22nd King George the Third reviewed the
Greys,&mdash;expressing his high admiration of the Regiment's appearance
and discipline.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the time describe the day as particularly
fine, and allude to the great crowds assembled to witness "the
martial appearance and correct man&#339;uvring of this gallant old corps."</p>

<p>The Regiment now went to Ipswich and Bury St. Edmund's,
and in the autumn extended its quarters to Norwich. In 1774 it
marched to York, and again sent detachments on coast duty. In
the spring of 1775 it marched again North, and remained in Scotland
until April, 1776. After this it spent 11 months in Lancashire.
Next the Regiment went to Worcester for a summer station, passing
the autumn in Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Pershore, and Ludlow.</p>

<p>In 1778, when the War of Independence broke out, no heavy
cavalry corps were sent to North America; but the establishment of
the Greys was increased by some 250 men and horses, and 48 of these
were equipped as Light Dragoons. The "light" part of the Regiment
now consisted of 6 sergeants, 6 corporals, and 84 private men; and in
April, 1779, these light horsemen were incorporated, with detachments
from the 7th, 15th and 16th Dragoons, into a Regiment which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
numbered 21st Dragoons. During the summer of 1779 the Greys
were encamped on Salisbury Plain, and other Dragoon Regiments with
them. In November the Regiment went into quarters at Marlborough,
Chippenham, Colne, and Malmesbury.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1780 they marched into Worcestershire.</p>

<p>In January, 1781, two troops requisitioned by magistrates on
account of disturbances, marched to Ludlow. In June the Regiment
marched into Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>In 1782 the Regiment was at Durham, and in 1783 went north
to Scotland. In this year, peace having been made with the United
States of America, the Regiment's establishment was reduced to
232 all told.</p>

<p>In 1784 they marched south, and were stationed 11 months
in Manchester.</p>

<p>In April, 1785, they went to Worcester.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1786 they occupied extensive cantonments in
Dorsetshire, and early in 1787 four troops were called in to aid the
civil power in Wiltshire. In June the Regiment marched into
quarters in Hampshire.</p>

<p>In April, 1788, they were in quarters near Hounslow, and thence
went to Ipswich, removing in the summer of 1789 to Nottinghamshire
and Lincolnshire. Early in 1790 the Regiment marched into
Yorkshire; from there 3 troops were soon sent to Newcastle-on-Tyne,
and in September the other 3 troops marched to Durham. In the
spring of 1791 they marched to Scotland, returning in the spring of
1792, and quartering in Lancashire. In December, 1792, an increase
of 60 men was ordered.</p>

<p>The French Revolution having broken out, the Regiment was,
in 1793, made up to 9 troops of 54 non-commissioned officers and
men each; and soon 4 troops were ordered to be held perfectly ready
for foreign service.</p>

<p>On January 20th, 1793, Louis the Sixteenth was murdered. The
French envoy was at once ordered to leave England, and on February
the 3rd the Convention declared war against England. The French
attacked Holland, and a united British and Hanoverian force, commanded
by the Duke of York, went to the help of the Dutch.</p>

<p>On July the 9th, 1793, 4 troops of the Greys embarked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Blackwall for Flanders. The rest were left at Worcester, Tewkesbury
and neighbouring towns. The 4 troops landed at Ostend on
July 16th, and marching towards France joined the army laying siege
to Valenciennes. After Valenciennes had been taken, they were at
first occupied in covering the siege of Dunkirk; but this was soon
abandoned, and they were next occupied near Lisle, and made a
successful charge against some French cavalry on the heights of Cateau
Cambresis. In November the 4 troops marched to Ghent.</p>

<p>The 5 troops remaining in England were increased to 80 men each.</p>

<p>In February, 1794, the 4 troops quitted Ghent for Beveren.</p>

<p>On April the 17th, after joining the army on the plains of Cateau,
they supported the infantry attack on the villages of Vaux and Pr&ecirc;mont.</p>

<p>At day-break on May the 10th, the army was in position on the
heights in front of Tournay, the Greys being formed in column of
troops behind the left wing. The Bays, Greys, and Inniskilling
Dragoons forming one brigade, advanced in open column of half-squadrons,
with the Duke of York at their head; on approaching the
enemy they formed line under a heavy cannonade and charged.</p>

<p>The following is in the Honourable J. W. Fortescue's account,
Vol. IV., p. 249, of his splendid new <cite>History of the British Army</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At last, however, a little to the south of Willems, the battalion-guns
of the British infantry came up and opened fire, when the
French, after receiving a few shots, began to waver. The squadrons
again charged, and an officer of the Greys, galloping straight at the
largest of the squares, knocked down three men as he rode into it,
wheeled his horse round and overthrew six more, and thus made a
gap for the entry of his men. The sight of one square broken and
dispersed demoralised the remainder of the French. Two more
squares were ridden down, and for the third time the British sabres
had free play among the French infantry.... Not for eighteen
years was the British Cavalry destined again to ride over French
battalions as they rode on this day; and then Stapleton Cotton was
fated once more to be present, leading not a squadron of Carabiniers,
but a whole division of horse to the charge at Salamanca. But the
10th of May 1794 is chiefly memorable as marking the date on
which the new French infantry showed itself not unworthy of the old."</p>

<p>In November, 1795, the 4 troops of Greys embarked at Bremen
for England and landed at South Shields on Christmas Eve. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
here they went to Northallerton, and in February, 1796, joined the
rest of the Regiment at Canterbury.</p>

<p>In July of this year the Regiment was encamped near Weymouth;
in September it went into quarters at Dorchester, Bridport, Weymouth,
and Wareham.</p>

<p>Late in 1797 the Regiment marched to Nottingham, Loughborough,
Leicester, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch; in July, 1798, it was
encamped in Windsor Forest, and in September went from there to
Birmingham, Coventry, and Lichfield.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1799 the Regiment went to Dorchester,
Bridport, and Weymouth. A ninth troop was now added, and in April,
1800, a tenth was added. A force called the Fencible Cavalry was
disbanded, and from it 81 men, with 220 horses, were drafted to
the Greys.</p>

<p>In October, 1800, the Regiment marched to Salisbury, Southampton,
Blandford, Rumsey, and Portsmouth.</p>

<p>In 1801 the Greys marched to Dorchester.</p>

<p>Now came the inevitable policy of parsimony, and no war being
on hand, the Greys establishment was reduced to 8 troops of 29 officers,
8 quarter-masters, 28 sergeants, 8 trumpeters, and 480 rank and file,
including 10 dismounted men in each troop.</p>

<p>In July, 1802, the Regiment marched to Croydon, Rumsey, and
Eastbourne.</p>

<p>The folly of reduction was now shown. War opened with France
again in 1803, and the Regiment's strength was brought up to 10
troops. Its efficiency was also promoted by adding 3 captains, and
thus releasing the field officers from the charge of troops. The
establishment now became 51 officers, 10 quarter-masters, 54 sergeants,
10 trumpeters, and 1,000 rank and file.</p>

<p>In June, 1803, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, staying
there nearly two years, the period when Napoleon Bonaparte, First
Consul of France, was hourly expected to attempt an attack on our
coast.</p>

<p>In May of 1805 the Greys marched to Ipswich and Colchester.</p>

<p>On Thursday, January 9th, 1806, Lord Nelson was buried in
St. Paul's Cathedral, and two squadrons of the Greys took part in the
procession on this occasion.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Regiment marched into Yorkshire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Northumberland; and the talk of invasion having passed off, the
Regiment was once more reduced, and the establishment became
40 officers, 10 quarter-masters, and 854 non-commissioned officers
and men.</p>

<p>In January, 1807, the Regiment marched to Scotland. In June,
1808, the Regiment sailed to Ireland. In June, 1809, an alteration
was made by substituting a regimental quarter-master and 10 troop
sergeant-majors, in the place of the 10 troop quarter-masters.</p>

<p>In 1810 the Regiment sailed from Dublin for England, and now
occupied quarters in Yorkshire and Lancashire. In the spring of 1813
the quarters of the Regiment were extended to Leicestershire and
Derbyshire. Two troops were left at Birmingham, and in December
8 troops marched to Canterbury, remaining there and at Dover,
Deal, and Hythe.</p>

<p>The following account relates to the review in Hyde Park before
the Prince Regent, the King of Prussia, and the Czar of Russia, on
June 21st, 1814, and is from <cite>The Times</cite> of Wednesday, the 23rd:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is little less than impossible to keep pace in the public journals with all
the movements of the illustrious personages now in the British metropolis, or
to describe the affectionate zeal with which they are received.... Our army
has now, with great reason, become as much our boast as our navy, and therefore
the display of its merits&mdash;of the persons, the horses, the accoutrements, of
its component parts&mdash;ought to excite as great an interest as the exhibition of
our ships of war and their equipages. Their Majesties, we have reason to
believe, were as highly gratified by the review as British hearts could wish. A
detachment of the Greys attended the great potentates, accompanied by the
Hetman Platoff and a small detachment of Cossacks.</p>

<p>"They were received with the loudest shouts by the populace. The Prince
Regent, who was accompanied on one side by the King of Prussia, and on the
other by the Emperor of Russia, was greeted with high applause. He was
followed by Blucher and a most magnificent staff, superbly attired."</p></div>

<p>In July, 1814, the Regiment was reduced to 8 troops,
amounting to 584 officers and men, including 16 dismounted men
for each troop. In a few months the Regiment went into winter
quarters at Bristol and Trowbridge.</p>

<p>Early in 1815 Napoleon was once more in France, and the Greys
establishment was again made up to 10 troops, comprising in all 946
officers and men. Six troops were to be held in readiness to go abroad,
and the other four were marched to Ipswich.</p>

<p>Before giving the several interesting contemporary records of
1815 in possession of the Regiment, allusion must be made to the two
touching original records now belonging to the Regiment, relating to
Colonel Hamilton, the commanding officer killed at Waterloo. One
is a letter of May 15th, 1793, acquainting a Mr. Anderson that "the
King had been pleased to appoint Jamie a cornet in the Royal North
British Dragoons."</p>

<p>"The letters in this book relating to the history of Lieutenant-Colonel
Inglis Hamilton were presented to the officers of the Regiment, on the occasion
of the celebration of the Bicentenary of the raising of the Regiment, on the
18th of June, 1881, by the family of the late Peter Mackenzie, Esq., author of
the 'Reminiscences of Glasgow.' The papers were entrusted to the charge of
Mr. Mackenzie by the sisters of Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Major-General Hamilton has to acquaint Mr. Anderson that he received
on Sunday night a card from Lord Amherst, acquainting him that the King had
been pleased to appoint Jamie a cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the same time his Lordship called him James Hamilton. How this has
happened he cannot say, as the General has received no explanation, but can
assure Mr. Anderson that he gave in his name when in London to the
Secretary at War Jas. Anderson; he likewise gave in his name on Watson's
return from Glasgow, my godson James Anderson, since which he has heard
little until last night, but has wrote this day.</p>

<p>"If the nomination is given in and past recall, the General hopes that
Mr. Anderson will agree to it, as it must be of such advantage to the young
man. Besides, he has to acquaint Mr. Anderson that he always intended to
leave Jamie something handsome at his death, on condition that he bore his
name, and will condescend to say, if agreed to, that the annual rent in money,
bondes, or stock shall exceed the rents of Murdiestone when the General's
father changed his name from Hamilton to Inglis, by virtue of the testator's
will.</p>

<p>"The General wishes that Mr. Anderson will observe that this is every
day done both in North and South Britain, and was the constant practice
among the ancients. On these considerations, and seeing it will save a thousand
pounds and enable him to assist Willie and John, which it is the General's
purpose to do, he hopes that Mr. Anderson will cheerfully acquiss."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I recd. your letter of the 7th inst. and with reference to a letter I
wrote Mr. Une not knowing the address of my lamented friend Col. Hamilton's
sister, I beg leave to inform you that with deep regret I have ascertained
the intelligence of the Col.'s death to be correct. His bravery was most gallant
throughout the 18th, and he was killed giving a word of command. Several
accounts agree that latterly in the action he was seen by his men <em>still</em> commanding
with both arms shot off, holding the reins of his charger in his teeth. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
must have been momentary desperation. I saw a letter from an officer in the
Greys (Gen. Hamilton of Dalziel's son) stating that it was ascertained that on
examining Col. Hamilton's body previous to his burial on the field of battle he
had received a shot through his heart, and Sir James Stewart showed me a letter
from Col. Clark of the Greys mentioning that the Colonel's body had been
found and had been buried."</p>

</p>

<p>"About ninety years ago the 21st, or North British Fusiliers, were
engaged in the American war, and fighting at Ticonderoga.... The Fusiliers
were then commanded by Colonel Inglis Hamilton, formerly of the Scots Greys,
who inherited from a long line of ancestors the property of Murdiestoun, in the
vicinity of Glasgow.</p>

<p>"William Anderson, a Glasgow man of excellent character, was a private
in the 21st, and rose to the rank of Sergeant-Major. He had born to him in
America two sons, James and John, and two daughters. Having been wounded
he was discharged with a pension, and with his family settled in the Gallowgate
of Glasgow.... Colonel Hamilton, having attained the rank of Major-General,
left the service, and with an old sister resided at his estate of
Murdiestoun.</p>

<p>"... One day the General driving in his carriage, saw to his surprise,
Sergeant-Major Anderson playing with his children on the opposite side of the
road, and no less to the surprise and delight of the old Sergeant, he saw his
General, and felt the grasp of his affectionate hand. The children remembered
the General, who delighted with the appearance of James, seized him in his arms
and tossed him in the air, which so charmed the boy that he exclaimed,&mdash;Do it
again, General; please give me another toss over your head. From that day
the General's heart was knit to Jamie Anderson. He showed the greatest
kindness to all the family, educating the boys in the grammar school, and afterwards
at the University; while the girls received the best teaching which the
boarding schools of Glasgow could then afford.</p>

<p>"James moreover was taught riding, a pony was provided for his daily use;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and Murdiestoun became his home almost as much as the more humble, but not
less happy and contented abode in the Gallowgate. This kindness had a
purpose in it. In carrying out this purpose, the General obtained a commission
for 'Jamie' as a Cornet in the Scots Greys. The Secretary at War assumed
the boy's name to be Inglis Hamilton....</p>

<p>"Years passed. The Cornet behaved like an officer and a gentleman, and
was the pride of the old General, who had the satisfaction of seeing him become
Lieutenant-Colonel of his regiment, respected and beloved by officers and men.
The General in the meantime made his will, leaving his property to James and
his heirs male....</p>

<p>"The General died, and according to a request written by him and placed
in his prayer book, Jamie acted as chief mourner, accompanied by the nobility
and gentry of the county."</p></div>

</p>

<p>"I fear you have again an opportunity of calling me an idle correspondent.
I have certainly delayed writing to you much longer than I intended. In
truth my time is totally occupied in drills, &amp;c. three times a day, an hour and a
half each. I rise every morning at six and attend at the Riding School till nine.</p>

<p>"I have already made great progress in the equestrian art.</p>

<p>"I and a brother Cornet (junior to myself) perform together.</p>

<p>"The method of riding is altogether different to that of the country squires.
At present we ride without stirrups, in order that we may obtain a firm seat.
We must leap the bar, ditches and go through all the different evolutions of the
field exercise, &amp;c. without stirrups, indeed I find I can already ride better without
their support than with it. So much for horsemanship.</p>

<p>"The reason I have so much drilling is I much wish to go on service and
share the honours my comrades are likely to reap.</p>

<p>"We are in daily expectation of receiving orders to proceed to Flanders.</p>

<p>"The Regiment is without doubt the best disciplined and the most crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
cavalry corps in the service. I don't think there is a private in it under 5 feet
11 inches, and the officers are a fine gentlemanly set of fellows. There are only
three Scotchmen among the officers, but the privates are in general Scotch.</p>

<p>"The horses are all grey and in excellent condition.</p>

<p>"Mine is two inches too low but the colonel has passed him for a second
charger. He has desired I will get one much stronger and higher immediately
as a first charger, but where I am to find a horse of that description I am at a
loss to know.</p>

<p>"It is the general opinion there will be more hard fighting and more
bloodshed than in any preceding war, as that arch fellow Bony (who has been
too deep for all our wise heads) will dispute every inch of ground with the
sword.</p>

<p>"Pray have you been to Easton lately? What does the old gent say of
the present appearance of things?</p>

<p>"If we go on service I shall be obliged to call on him for a further advance
of cash, as I shall have to purchase many essential though expensive articles,
such as tent and tent equipage, &amp;c., and many other things necessary for service.</p>

<p>"Our dress altogether is extremely rich and consequently costs lots of
money. The Court dress coat alone is 40 guineas. It is covered with lace
from head to foot. The jackets are handsome, but they only cost &pound;15 15<em>s.</em>
each. Every other part of the equipment is equally as expensive.</p>

<p>"In fact we make a most dashing appearance. I should like much to meet
the old Buck at Bath or Clifton. I do not think he would know his hopeful
son....</p>

<p>"I have only time to tell you that we received orders yesterday to
hold ourselves in perfect readiness for foreign service.</p>

<p>"To-day another order arrived for the regiment to proceed to North Fleet
(about 30 miles below London) and there embark for the Continent. It will be
about seven days' march from hence to North Fleet. The order and march
came so near together that most of us are unprovided with tents, camp equipage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
canteens, &amp;c., all which necessaries I must order from London to meet me by
the time I arrive at North Fleet. We have been long expecting this move.
Since I joined I have not had a spare half hour. Three drills a day on horseback
and on foot I assure you did not a little fatigue my bones. However, I trust
I am now a tolerable good match for a Frenchman.</p>

</p>

<p>"I have taken the earliest opportunity to inform you of my arrival
as far as this place. I should have written sooner, but my time has been most
fully engaged since we landed. We are quartered for a day or two in a village
contiguous to this town, are in hourly expectation of receiving orders to proceed
to the frontiers to join the army under the Duke of Wellington. There are an
immense number of troops daily arriving, and the united forces of the Allies,
will it is stated, in a short time amount to 900,000 men.</p>

<p>"We are here quite ignorant of the politics of the country. Nothing is
said of Buonaparte, but he has doubtless many adherents in Flanders. Deserters
from his army are constantly coming into Ghent. They state that they receive
neither their rations nor pay. Some of the inhabitants seem well inclined
towards the English and are what may be termed hospitable, but adieu to
English comforts.</p>

<p>"We embarked at Gravesend on the 15th, sailed on the 16th, and reached
Ostend on the 19th. We had a rough passage the last day and night&mdash;the
wind blowing hard right in our teeth, with snow storms. Many of the horses
were a good deal bruised, but none sustained any material injury. We expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
some hard fighting before the business will be settled. Never was a Regiment
in better condition for service than this, both in men and appointments.</p>

at present in an ill state of health.</p>

</p>

<p>"Week after week has passed without my having the gratification of
hailing your long expected, most welcome letter. I assure you I am most
anxious to hear from you, having as yet received only one letter from old
England....</p>

<p>"My father has not yet replied to the letters I sent him from Bristol, but
my sister says he intends advancing the money I applied for. I shall therefore
write to him very soon on the subject as my last bills are unpaid in London for
camp equipage, &amp;c., and the tradesmen are continually dunning for their
accounts to be settled. Exchange between this country and England is
extremely low, only 17&#8531; francs for a Bank of England &pound;1. I shall therefore
have as little money as possible sent here. We, however, do not expect to
receive any pay for four months. The Regiment has been here about a
fortnight. It is a miserable small village, not large enough to contain one
troop. The remainder, officers and men, are quartered at cottages in the
neighbourhood. A pig-sty in England is a palace to my quarters. Hosts of
lice, bugs, fleas, and filth of every description, abound in a most extraordinary
degree in all the habitations of these dirty vagabonds. To counteract, however,
as much as possible, the unpleasant effects of sleeping in such a dirty hut, I
have pitched my tent and sleep quite comfortably <i lang="es">su Dio</i>, in a green field totally
independent of the above-mentioned black backed gentry.</p>

<p>"The men and women are very plain, with mouths that reach from ear to
ear, and are extremely ignorant. It is with great difficulty I can make them
understand my wants as few can speak French, nothing but the Flemish is
spoken among the lower classes. The only answer I can ever obtain is "yaw,"
in English, "yes."</p>

<p>"To-morrow we are again reviewed, for the fourth time since we landed, by
the Earl of Uxbridge, who commands the English cavalry, and on Wednesday
this regiment will be inspected by the Prince of Orange and a Prussian General.
I assure you we are considered the finest cavalry corps on the continent. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
one wishes to see us, and all the Generals that have reviewed us, speak in the
highest possible terms of the excellent appearance and condition of the men and
horses. A Prussian General expressed a wish to see an English Dragoon
Regiment, the Greys were immediately brought forward as a specimen. In fact
we have every compliment paid us.</p>

<p>"A few years ago the Regiment behaved most gallantly in this country
in several actions and I think it is probable they will distinguish themselves in
this campaign, for I never saw men more anxious for an opportunity. You
may perhaps think I speak with partiality, but I assure you what I have
expressed is the real matter of fact. We are within about 35 miles of the
French army&mdash;a day's march.</p>

<p>"The English army will not advance till the Russians, Cossacks, &amp;c.,
come up. There are a great number of Prussian, Hanoverian and Belgic
troops in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear old Blucher has been insulted by some Saxon troops.
He is a gallant old cock.</p>

<p>"Whatever the newspapers say of the increasing popularity of the Bourbons,
you have no idea how much Bonaparte is adored by the lower order. There
is scarce a house here from which there is not one or two young men now
serving in the French army, and the deserters are by no means so numerous as
the papers would persuade us.</p>

<p>"The French are collecting a very large force on the frontiers. At Lisle
they have near 40,000 men, at Valenciennes and other places they are also very
strong. It is the unanimous opinion of the army that we shall have some very
hard fighting before we reach Paris. Much will depend on the first battle. It
is generally supposed we shall advance in the course of a week and that
hostilities will commence immediately.</p>

<p>"I trust the next time I write to you we shall be on the road to the
French Capital.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say the horse I bought in London has turned out very bad.
I shall be obliged to send to England for another. The grey I took from
Easton is a very promising horse, but is rather too slight for my weight.</p>

<p>"I must now bid you adieu.</p>

<p>"Give my kindest regards to all the family at Cockshut.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"In the course of a short excursion which I was obliged to make last
week thro' the lower part of Lancashire, I met at the Rectory house, Middleton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with Dr. Hardie, a young Scotch physician of considerable eminence in his
profession at Manchester, where he practises. The battle of Waterloo being
accidentally mentioned, Dr. H. amused myself and the rest of the party after
supper with various anecdotes of the gallantry and success of Sergeant Ewart
of the Scots Greys, who performed prodigies of valour on that day and whose
good fortune it was to be the captor of one of the three French Eagles that
were taken during the battle.</p>

<p>"To a remark made by one of the party that he supposed Ewart must be
very proud of the honour of having taken a French Eagle, Dr. H. observed
that he always seemed to speak of it with much indifference, and that when
once asked the name of the regiment to which the Eagle belonged, he answered,
with much sangfroid, 'The Invincible or the like.' The only exploit, Dr. H.
observed in continuance, of which Ewart appears to be proud, is the summary
revenge which he had an opportunity of taking for the death of Mr. Kinchant,
who was the cornet of his own troop.... On the morning of the 18th, a
little before 12 o'clock, the Scots Greys were ordered to charge a body of French
infantry at some distance, which order they instantly proceeded to execute in a
column of two deep, Sergeant Ewart in this charge being the front man of
Cornet Kinchant. Ewart, on reaching the enemy, immediately singled out a
French officer, whom, from being a very expert swordsman, he soon disarmed
and was on the point of cutting him down, when Mr. Kinchant, on hearing the
officer crying out, 'Ah, mercy, mercy, Angleterre,' said, 'Sergeant, Sergeant,
spare his life, and let us take him prisoner.' Ewart considering that moment as
a period for slaughter and destruction, and not the proper time for taking
prisoners, replied, 'As it is your wish, sir, it shall be done.' (I ought to have
said that the French officer, prior to Mr. K.'s address to the Sergeant, had cried
that he had surrendered and was their prisoner and had dropped his sabre.)
Mr. K. to whom the French officer had delivered up his sword, addressed him
in French and ordered him to move to the rear. Ewart was preparing to
proceed in the charge when he heard the report of a pistol behind him, and
turning round, from a suspicion of some treachery, the first object which met
his eye was Mr. K. falling backwards over his horse, apparently in a lifeless
state, and the French officer attempting to hide his pistol under his coat.
Indignant at such a dastardly act, Ewart instantly wheeled round, and was again
entreated by this villain for mercy in the same supplicating terms as before.
The only answer which he returned was, 'Ask mercy of God, for the deil a bit
will ye get at my hands,' and with one stroke of his sabre, severed his head
from his body, leaving it a lifeless trunk on the field of battle."</p></div>

<p>"We were quartered in small villages between Brussels and Ghent, and
chiefly in farm houses.</p>

<p>"I went to bed in my farm house about twelve o'clock on the night of the
15th of June 1815, and was scarcely asleep when the trumpets sounded the
turn out: in an instant we were out of bed, the clothes out of the washtub, and
in a short time we were ready to march: long indeed before orders came to tell
us to what point our march was to be directed. At length an order came which
directed us to proceed to Ninove, where we should receive further orders. We
were soon there: but the day was gone, and it was dark, and the firing had
entirely ceased before we reached the army, having been repeatedly halted on
the road during the day, from an apparent want of knowing where to go, and
at a time too when the French Cavalry were charging our Infantry with considerable
and unusual success.</p>

<p>"We encamped in a clover field for the night. A few of us went to a
village not far off, which had been completely plundered: we there met with
some soldiers of the Highland Brigade, who gave us a most dismal account of
the manner in which the French Cavalry had attacked them on the previous
day. Never having before seen our army other than victorious, we felt rather
dispirited at these accounts, and had not Buonaparte, with his characteristic
selfishness, sent for the division which ought to have supported Ney, and which
division never fired a shot during the day, there can be little doubt that the
battle, instead of being a drawn one, must have turned out positive, and with
the aid of his cavalry, of which we had none, Napoleon would have completely
defeated the allied troops.</p>

<p>"On this day Buonaparte kept his own opposed to our army, notwithstanding
he neutralized one of his whole divisions, and he totally defeated the
Russian army with a loss, according to their own accounts, of twenty-five
thousand men, as their total loss as returned by themselves was upwards of
thirty-three thousand: and they could not at Wavre and Waterloo have lost five
thousand men.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<p>"The next morning we received orders to retire, and to cover the
retreat of the army into the lines at Mont St. Jean. The infantry retired
by the high road: the cavalry were formed in line: and the different
brigades fronted alternately to prevent the advance of the enemy's cavalry and
cannon.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the torrents of rain which fell, the French continued to
press us closely: their light cavalry charged ours on the road and drove them
back: when Lord Uxbridge, seeing them do so, charged at the head of a
regiment of the Life Guards and completely upset them, they being unable to
stand against the superior weight of the men and horse of the household troops.
At this moment it rained in such a way as I never saw either before or since:
it rained as if the water were tumbled out of tubs: there was also a good deal
of thunder with it. Some of the hussars that were driven in upon us were so
covered with mud that it was impossible to distinguish their features. The
ground was so soft that at every step our horses sank half way to the knees:
and in several places, in our passing over fallow land, it had the appearance of a
lake, the rain falling upon it faster than it could either be absorbed or run off.
It continued to rain and we to retire till we halted for the night in the position
of Mont St. Jean: we were placed in bivouac at the distance of three hundred
yards from the front of a farm house which lay between us and the village of
Waterloo. The firing of cannon continued till it was dark: but as it was on
the other side of the hill we saw nothing of what passed, hearing merely the
cannonade. It continued to rain and thunder during the whole of the night:
being hungry and cold, and wet through to the skin, we passed a most wretched
night: the ground upon which we lay was a fallow upon which it was impossible
to lie: we therefore obtained some straw at the farm house: we found there
also some wood with which we made a fire, although from the rain it was
difficult to keep it burning....</p>

<p>"In spite of the rain we slept pretty soundly, lying at our horses' heads,
they being formed in line, and linked together, but we were repeatedly awoke
during the night, by their taking fright at the lightning and thunder, at the
same time advancing over us! but no one was hurt! and as the nights in the
middle of summer are short, we arose with the day break: a miserable looking
set of creatures we all were&mdash;covered with mud from head to foot&mdash;our white
belts dyed with the red from our jackets, as if we had already completed the
sanguinary work, which we were soon about to begin.</p>

<p>"(Sir W. Ponsonby) the General who commanded the brigade, had also
commanded our brigade in the Peninsula, and as I was the only subaltern in it
whom he knew, he asked me to be with him on the 17th and on this day also.
This was just what I wished, for a man sees more, and suffers less in action
when on the Staff, than with a regiment, being obliged in the latter case to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
stand still and be shot at, while in the former he is constantly on the alert
carrying orders, and seeing and hearing everything that is going on.</p>

<p>"When the General appeared on the ground I joined him, his Aide-de-Camp
being at Brussels, whither the General had sent him, not expecting the
action to begin so early if at all that day: his major of brigade and an officer
who acted as <em>extra Aide-de-Camp</em>, were however with him.</p>

<p>"We proceeded, after we had looked at the brigade, to the top of the hill,
leaving the brigade drawn up close at the bottom of it. When we reached the
summit we found the Duke of Richmond and one of his sons, as amateurs in
plain clothes, with a number of officers, having their glasses on the look out for
the Prussians: but we could see nothing of them, although we were on the
extreme left of our army. Someone thought he saw a Prussian picquet at the
foot of some trees near a wood, and for a time we were all of the same opinion&mdash;so
fondly do people's hopes make things appear in the desired light: but there
was no Prussian picquet, and the whole party seemed much dispirited. At this
moment occurred a circumstance not mentioned by any writer whose account of
the battle of Waterloo I have read: Buonaparte appeared in the front of his
troops, and the loudest cheering began on the left of the French, and ran along
their whole line. I confess that I never before felt so disheartened: it had
evidently a powerful effect upon all present, but not one of our party said a
word about it: nor was any attempt at a reply to it made on our side, by the
troops near us: they were however chiefly Belgians, with the Highland Brigade,
and some of the other regiments, which had suffered severely on the 16th.</p>

<p>"At this time we did not know whether we were to fight that day or not:
for having retired the whole of the day before, we thought as the Prussians
were not to be seen, that we should again retreat, and seeing, or rather hearing
by their shouts, that the French were in such spirits, ours were not enlivened by
the circumstance, but the very reverse.</p>

<p>"However, immediately afterwards the cannonade began on the right and
increased every minute, till it was opposite to us, a gentle breeze wafting the
smoke of the French guns towards us, which wholly prevented our seeing
anything in front of us. Our brigade continued drawn up at the bottom of the
hill, and I was sent to desire the commanding officers of the different regiments
to draw them up as close to the hill as possible, as they began to suffer both
from shells and shot, the effects of the cannonade....</p>

<p>"The cannonade now greatly increased, and under cover of the smoke
from both their cannon and our own, the French advanced the division the
Count D'Erbon,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who had by this time got close to our infantry, who opened
their fire upon them: but the enemy much more powerful in numbers continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>to push on. Our general observing what was about to take place, immediately
sent me down to bring up the brigade with all speed. I did so: the general
met us just before we reached the summit of the hill: had we been five minutes
later, it would have been too late to have effected what we did, as the French
had charged our infantry with the bayonet, who fled through the intervals
of our squadrons, but immediately rallying, advanced again with us to the
hedge, a little way down the hill, where they fired a volley at the French, when
they were close to each other. Our three regiments of dragoons were not quite
in line: the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons were on the right, and some yards in advance, so
that the general placing himself in front of them, they charged a little before the
other regiments did: the French gave us only a partial volley, being in some
disorder in consequence of their previous exertions against our infantry, and
from having no idea of our brigade being so near at hand. We accordingly
<em>went right through them</em>: not a horse, as is usually the case, went round from
the fire, and the enemy threw down their arms.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I make no attempt to alter the wording.&mdash;E. A.</p></div>

<p>"The other two regiments came up in succession, but were a little delayed
by the hedge: we again charged&mdash;the general riding along the whole line to the
left of the brigade&mdash;so that we saw the whole three regiments charge: the result
in each instance the same&mdash;namely&mdash;the enemy throwing down their arms, and
begging their lives.</p>

<p>"In this conflict two eagles were taken, one by the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons, and
the other by &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons.</p>

<p>"After passing through and killing, wounding, and making prisoners the
whole of the advanced column of the French, we ought to have stopped and
re-formed the brigade: but our men were not contented with what they had
done: they still went on. The General, his aide-de-camp and I, got however
about thirty of them collected together, in the hope of reassembling all who
remained of those who had come on: for a great many, particularly of the
officers, had remained with the prisoners: when Colonel of the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons
came past us at full gallop, with about twenty men of his regiment following
him: in a second all the men which we had collected set off in the same direction.
In the hopes of stopping them we followed and passed between the columns of
the French infantry, when their red lances closed behind us. One of the red
lancers put his lance to my horse's head, I made a cut at his arm as I passed
him; and as I did not look behind me to see whether I had struck him or his
lance, I should not have known that I had cut his arm, had I not in recovering
my sword thrown the blood on my white pouch belt.</p>

<p>"On inspecting the sword, I saw that I had succeeded in wounding the
lancer and possibly thus saved my own life. My fears were, when I saw him
thrust at my horse's reins that he would shoot me with his pistol, having heard
of the red lancers sometimes doing so.</p></div>

</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Upon getting quite clear of the French, the first person I saw was
Captain &mdash;&mdash; our General's extra aide-de-camp, who had lost sight of the
General some minutes before I had, and a little way before us was Captain
---- of my regiment who had been with me in the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons in Spain.
He returned to his regiment to collect his troops: and the aide-de-camp and I
sought for assistance with the view of recovering the General, and such other of
our officers and men who were in the hands of the French. I went to
Lord E. R. S. who commanded the Life Guard Brigade, and found him alone
with the exception of Lieutenant M. and Colonel Harvey of the 14th.</p>

<p>"Lord E. R. S. said to me, 'You see Mr. &mdash;&mdash; I can do nothing for you.'
Upon this I went to a regiment that afterward ran off the field altogether, and
asked the Colonel in French, to advance, and that I would show him where our
General was prisoner; but he declined moving, saying he had no orders; and
he was right, as it would have been in vain to make the attempt.</p>

<p>"A little further to the left, I found Sir J. Vandeleur's brigade in column of
divisions and an old brother officer of mine in the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons, was riding in
front of the General giving him advice. 'No orders' was again the reply to
my request. I then joined my regiment.</p>

<p>"After being once more in the form of a regiment, we retired to a situation
behind a wood where the enemy's shot and shells passed over us: here the
regiment, about three hundred strong, was re-formed under the command of
Colonel &mdash;&mdash;; we were then marched up to the slaughter afresh, and placed
nearly in the centre of the enemy. On our right was the first brigade of
cavalry, about the same in number as ourselves. On each side of us were some
regiments of infantry formed in squares&mdash;some Hanoverian, some British.</p>

<p>"Repeatedly during the evening we retired, either by orders given, or
voluntarily after the charges were made. But whenever we were out of the
fire of the enemy we faced about and resumed our former position.</p>

<p>"The infantry squares did the same, but were also brought back to their
positions; and I observed the officers in some of the Hanoverian regiments
exerting themselves to the utmost to keep their men in order. We were twice
led on by the Earl of Uxbridge, and charged the squares of the French infantry
opposed to us, but were as often repulsed, losing about half our number every
time.</p>

<p>"The first time we charged, the first brigade of cavalry on our right
charged at the same moment, and having received the fire of their square of
infantry before we did ours, they wheeled about and charged as we advanced:
so great was the confusion that the General commanding them rode up against
me, I being on the left of our brigade, and he in the centre of his.</p>

<p>"I said 'Bad work this.' He shook his head, which I construed into
'It's all over with us.' Just as this occurred, the French square opposite to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
fired, and a great many of both brigades fell. This reminded me of an old
Scotch poacher who always waited till two partridges 'clipt' before he fired, by
clipt he meant, came so near that their wings touched each other.</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of the last of these charges the Earl of Uxbridge was
shot in the leg; we saw him lifted off his horse and carried off the field by six
men, Captain H. Seymour walking at their head. At this time the action was
evidently all against us, the enemy's infantry were steady in their squares; but
their heavy cavalry was as much reduced in number as our own: they however
sent out their skirmishers, who rode close up to us and fired their pistols in our
men's faces, who at last got in some degree unmanageable, and fired their
carbines in return over their horses' heads at the French, and it was with some
difficulty that we prevailed upon them to put up their carbines. At this
moment one of our men was shot dead. We retired about twenty yards, the
dead man at the same time being left sitting on his tired horse, quite upright,
yet completely dead. Fearing that such a spectacle might have a bad effect
upon the men, he was taken off his horse and carried to the rear; but I shall
never forget his singular and horrible appearance while he remained in the
position in which he was killed.</p>

<p>"During the evening we repeatedly retired to the bottom of the hill, and
as we supposed out of the reach of the fire of the enemy: but even here,
towards the close of the battle, we had men killed and wounded: a pretty
strong proof that the enemy had gained the summit of the hill, and therefore
crowned our position! Why they did not advance further I cannot say; but it
may be presumed that they were without any further order, and that probably
their superior officers were killed or wounded, and the other officers that they
had fulfilled their orders having gained the top of our position.</p>

<p>"As it got dusk we could plainly perceive the flashes of the Prussian guns
in the rear of the French army as we looked over it towards the left. This
may give a tolerably good idea of the time at which the French retired: it was
eight o'clock, and the victory to all appearance was then quite undecided.</p>

<p>"During nine hours we had been exposed to a fire, which had, by this
time, reduced our brigade from about fifteen hundred strong in the morning to
a mere skeleton of <em>thirty-three officers and men</em>, the number we mustered when
we encamped for the night!</p>

<p>"It was after nine o'clock at night when the French gave way, and our
whole line advanced: we, as well as the first brigade of cavalry, were now such
mere handfuls, that, of course, we could do nothing, but followed slowly in the
rear of others. We heard firing, but it was too dark to see anything clearly:
we heard also huzzas as the different charges were made by our light cavalry
upon the retreating enemy. We continued to advance along the right of the
road by which the French retired, and passed by many cannon and waggons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
which they had abandoned, when I heard some English voices calling out 'Are
these the Dragoons?' Upon which I answered 'Yes.' 'Then' continued the
voice 'here is Captain &mdash;&mdash; of the Dragoons badly wounded,' upon which I
immediately sent one of the men of his regiment, and one of the men of my
own, with him to Brussels. I heard nothing more of him for four years,
further than that he had got quite well, till going to visit some of my relations
at * * * in the east of Scotland, I found him quietly settled there, and in the
belief that his life had been saved by a French officer.</p>

<p>"When we halted for the night I was sent with a Cornet of the regiment
to the village of Waterloo to collect the stragglers, and bring them up the next
day. On my way to Brussels I overtook on the road Captain P&mdash;&mdash; of the
horse artillery, and rode with him into the town. He was so kind as to
inform a cousin of mine in the same corps that I was safe; and thus my friends
heard through him, that I was neither killed nor wounded.</p>

<p>"Upon entering into a large house at Waterloo we found every room in it
filled with either the dead or the dying. I was glad to get a chair, and sat down
at a table in a large room, in every corner of which were poor creatures groaning.
The master of the house having brought us a piece of bread and a bottle of wine,
we began to talk over the events of the day: and as he had been for years a
soldier of Buonaparte's himself, we found no lack of subjects for conversation.
After we had finished our bread and wine, which we enjoyed very much notwithstanding
the room was full of poor wounded human beings, we retired to a hay
loft for the night, which we passed in profound repose. In the morning we saw
the Belgians completing the plunder of a number of baggage waggons, which
stood in the yard of the house. Here some of our men joined us, and my
private servant came up from the rear to look for my body, he having been
informed by two different officers of the brigade whom he met on their way to
Brussels the evening before, that I was killed, assuring him that they had seen
me lying on the field of battle before they left it.</p>

<p>"I saw on my left, during one of the many times that we were in some
confusion, a soldier of the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons whose cheek, just as I looked at it,
opened, while I felt a ball pass close to my lips,&mdash;the man immediately fell off
his horse and I saw no more of him.</p>

<p>"Several years afterwards I inquired of the Surgeon of his regiment, and
found that he had recovered with the loss of his teeth on both sides, but that
no injury was done either to the upper or lower jaw, the ball having passed
between them. The man's name was Pye, the son of an English clergyman,
who had left his home and enlisted as a dragoon&mdash;he was probably a relation of
Southey's predecessor, the poet laureate of that name. After I had got as
many of our men ready to march as were in the village of Waterloo, we were
just setting off when we were joined by a party from Brussels under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of a senior officer to me, who had gone there to dinner the day before we
proceeded to join the regiment, taking the field of battle on our way, where we
found the dead officers of the regiment and buried them, and then proceeded
on. But we did not come up with the regiment till the day after when we
found it encamped for the night, and my troop without an officer."</p></div>

"<em>June 24th, 1815</em>.</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Captain</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Till this day, I have had no time to write to you. You must have
received e'er this the accounts of what happened on the 18th, the slaughter of
both armies has been terrible; we have lost three-fourths of our officers in
killed and wounded, 200 men, and nearly 800 horses, which was a pretty day's
work. The Grays took an Eagle, and the Royals another. I was Orderly
Officer to General Ponsonby, and was with him till he fell, the aide-de-camp
and I then cut our way through the enemy who had got into our rear.</p>

<p>"The first thing we did in the morning was to charge a column of French
infantry who had forced the left centre of our position, supported by the
Cuirassiers and some of the Imperial Guard; they had just driven the Belgians
from the heights and got possession of six guns, when Ponsonby led on the
Brigade in line; they immediately halted, fired a volley which dropped a few of
us, not a man or horse went about, and in a minute we were in the middle of
them; those to the rear of the column still continued to fire at us. After
killing I can't tell what number, we made all the rest prisoners, about 3,000,
which were immediately sent to the rear. Nothing could stop the men; they
went on, took a great many of the enemy's guns, and then, instead of halting,
charged the Lancers and Cuirassiers. At this moment I lost sight of the
General, who was killed, and cut my way to the rear, we being completely
overpowered by a fresh column of Infantry firing upon us and by the
Cuirassiers and Lancers having by this time rallied. We then retired and
three squadrons were formed, nine in the Brigade. We were then led to the
centre of the Army, where the battle became dreadful. We then charged a
square of Infantry on our left, and the Life Guards on our right; between the
two were formed the French Cuirassiers, and each flank of our two Brigades
rested on a square of Hanoverian Infantry. At this moment everyone thought
the battle lost, when we charged and the Life Guards and one half of our men
were destroyed. We threw the French into some confusion. The two
Brigades, the Life Guards and ourselves, were then formed into one squadron
of about 50 file, and we again charged the Cuirassiers in front of us; after
which we stood, and the French did the same, and fired at each other with our
carbines, not being more than forty yards from each other, both afraid to
advance for fear of the Infantry giving way. The French then brought up their
guns close to us, and our guns came up also and fired grape shot, the French
throwing something like broken glass amongst us, at least it seemed so, which
made some dreadful wounds. The Prussians fired the right of the French and
they gave way; all our light cavalry then charged, and we pursued them as long
as we could see them.</p></div>

<p>"At the end of the night I was sent to collect what men I could that had
gone off with the wounded, and all that were left with the regiment was
16 officers and men.</p>

<p>"I buried 8 officers the next day. Trotter was the first, he was
shot through the heart; I have written to his brother-in-law, and said I would
pay his bills and remit home the money that arose from his things being sold.
I have bought Colonel Hamilton's horse, which is a very fine one, 5 years old
and fit to carry 15 stone, for &pound;55; he refused &pound;100 for him often. When the
bills for Trotter's things are given, I shall send them either to you or the
agent. I lost some of my things, many officers their whole baggage. The
Belgian cavalry ran off to Brussels, saying the Army was defeated, and took our
baggage from the men by force; such a scene never was witnessed; the road at
last got blocked with waggons, and the Brunswick Hussars and the Belgians
seized upon everything. Let me hear from you as soon as possible. Write to
my father when you get this and say I am well. I shall write you next from
Paris, which is only 100 miles off, and with love to the children,</p>

<p>Letter from Cornet Clape (age 16), Scots Greys, to his Mother a
week after the Battle of Waterloo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I am afraid my long silence may have occasioned you some
uneasiness, particularly as the list of killed and wounded was so long making its
appearance. I would have written the day after the battle, but where could I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
find pen and ink, in the middle of a cornfield that was occupied the night before
by the enemy.</p>

<p>"I have certainly delayed writing to you this week, as I wanted to date
my letter from Paris, which we have been expecting to enter every day. As you
must now be certain that I have escaped without a broken head, and, as to my
health, I could not enjoy better, you may perhaps wish for the history of our
proceedings since we left Dunderhauten.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 15th we were roused from a most comfortable
sleep by the sound of Bugles, and noise of Sergeants crying 'Turn out,'
'Turn out!' We understood that the enemy had &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in some fear of our
pickets, and that we were to march about 15 miles, which we did, when we
were ordered to move on with all possible speed to the field of action. We
could hear the firing distinctly. We got to Ne&mdash;&mdash;lles about nine at night.
The firing had almost ceased, they were bringing in the wounded by hundreds.
We arrived on the field of Battle at 12 o'clock, where we bivouacked, after
having marched upwards of 50 miles. I rolled my cloak round me, and laid
down in some rye, where I slept as sound as ever I did in my life. On the
morning of the 17th the firing commenced early, chiefly skirmishing. We
could not see much of it, as we were covered by some rising ground. About
12 the Cavalry and Artillery took up positions upon the heights, to cover the
retreat of the Infantry. We commenced our march in their rear about 4 o'clock,
going through Jenappes: the rain fell in torrents. We soon after moved into
the cornfields, where we what they called shewed a front, retiring, then fronting
again. It was here that I first heard the whizzing of a Ball (there is really
something very grand about it). They were coming pretty fast and very near
us: however we had not a man killed, or wounded. At 7 we halted. The
firing had ceased. We had touched nothing since we left Dunderhau&mdash;but a
little bread and some &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Luckily we were near a very large farm house,
that supplied us with wood and straw. Such a scene of destruction I never
before witnessed. Ploughs, Harrows, Chairs, Tables, everything that would
burn was brought out to make fires. The straw was unthrashed. Old sows,
little pigs, calves and cows, all shared the same fate. I got a calves kidney, and
although it was not dressed in style (for one half of it was raw) I made a
very dainty meal of it.</p>

<p>"Oh: the night: what could be more uncomfortable. It began raining
again at 10, and we had nothing but our cloaks to cover us, which were soaked
in half an hour. On the morning of the 18th, the clouds began to break, the
sun made his appearance, and with good fires we soon got dry. At 10 the
firing commenced, we then moved to the bottom of the Hill, where Colonel
Hankins (?) Horse came down with him crossing a ditch: he was severely
hurt: we were just in the range of the 12 Pounders. We were ordered up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Hill, and after 3 hours, charged the enemy in the finest style possible. The
men were only too impetuous, nothing could stop them, they all separated, each
man fought by himself. I received a bullet from a Frenchman not 20 yards
from me: it went through my cloak, and lodged in my saddle, which it has
completely spoiled. I was the last person with Colonel Hamilton, who was just
like a madman. He was crying 'Halt, Halt, the Greys,' when there was none
to be seen. He then galloped completely into the French Lines, where I
thought it time to leave him; and make the best of my way back, which by the
greatest good fortune I effected. If we had been supported by the Light
Dragoons, we should have lost very few, and done three times the execution.
After we had collected all we could of the two Brigades, we retired behind a
wood, where we remained till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when we were ordered
to the right. Talk of the charge, I say it was a farce to this; this tried a
soldier: we were formed upon a hill facing the enemy, receiving his whole force
of Artillery and Musketry, without being able to return a shot. Really the
Bullets came as thick as Hail, the men were dropping on all sides, here we were
until half-past seven, diminishing every moment. We seemed to be placed
there only to be shot at, and the enemy threatening to charge us every instant
with 6 times our number. We thought all was lost, yet all resolved to stand to
the last. How can I express, my dear Mother, what we felt at seeing the Light
Dragoons and Artillery come up, and in an instant saw the whole French Army
in a rout. I must leave it to your own imagination. Our Regiment was only
36 strong when we marched to this Mount, when we left it we could only
muster 14. Colonel Clarke had two horses shot under him, and was wounded
himself. Major Vernon was wounded. Major Cheney had five horses shot
under him, and kept mounting the fresh ones with the same coolness that he
would had they been at his own stable door. My old mare received three slight
wounds. One was a bullet through her ear. Poor Whindham was shot through
the foot in the charge, he is doing well. What a scene did the field of action
present to our view. The wounded groaning, the dead cut up in a most hideous
manner. Horses standing upon three legs, you could not go a step without
stumbling over something. We that night occupied the very ground that the
enemy had bivouacked upon the previous night, and much obliged to them we
were for the huts they had left us. Since that time we have been taking forced
marches, and are now quartered at N&mdash;&mdash;, six miles from Paris. Sergeant
Ewart of the Greys took the Eagle."</p></div>

<p>"After a long silence on my part I shall attempt to give you a short extract
of our late movements. No doubt ere this time you will have seen the <cite>Gazette</cite>
containing a list of the killed and wounded of the Greys on the 18th ultimo. I
fancy it's much greater than has ever occurred since it was a regiment. We took
into the field that day three squadrons above sixty files each. Now we muster
<em>one</em> of little more than that number. I fear many of the men and horses
wounded, will never be again fit for service. Poor Colonel Hamilton led the
regiment in grand stile into action. You know him, more than courage is
required on such occasions.</p>

<p>"Major-General Ponsonby who commanded the Brigade fell early in the
action, as did Colonel H.; but which of them fell first, the former being in the
centre of the Brigade, and we being on the left, I do not know which of them
was first killed.</p>

<p>"No regiment could behave better than the Greys, Sergeant Ewart took an
Eagle, and the Royals another, which I believe were all that were taken, but
not one word in the Despatch by whom taken, indeed the Despatch is extremely
cold, and which is observed as such by everyone here, that has seen it. The
Heavy Brigade are mentioned as having done their duty&mdash;the first consists of
2 Regiments, Life Guards, Blues, and first Dragoon Guards. The 2nd, second
and sixth Dragoons: the Hussars and Light Dragoons had little or anything
(<em>sic</em>) to do except look on. Sergeant Ewart cut down the officer and two
soldiers before he could get possession of the Eagle.</p>

<p>"Hankin's horse fell with him at the commencement of the charge, we
saw nothing more of him for that day, had he remained a short time in the
field he must have been killed from his been (<em>sic</em>) so very inactive that the
French Lancers immediately got into our regt. after each charge, he having
no reserve he would certainly have been destroyed, the Light Dragoons this
time might have been made extremely useful.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hankin's horse also fell with him twice on the 17th, when we in
our turn covered the retreat of the British Army, which was done under a most
tremendous fire of cannon from the enemy, the First Dragoons only lost one
man, that was all, Lord Uxbridge's Hussars<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (the 7th) were to have been the
last and were so placed, but from some cause or other, behaved not very well,
indeed his Lordship said in front of the first Life Guards, that he must call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>upon them to advance <em>for that his own regiment had deserted him</em>. The Life
Guards charged a mass of Lancers on the <em>chasee</em> (<em>sic</em>), and which they tumbled
over like rats and the road covered with them and their horses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This Regiment no longer exists.&mdash;E. A.</p></div>

<p>"It is quite impossible to describe in a letter the battle of the 18th. The
carnage is far beyond belief.</p>

<p>"The enemy fought most fureyously, indeed they fought with halters
round their necks as well as their Master. The heavy Cavalry was the
admiration of the whole army, they bore down everything that came in their
way.</p>

<p>"I am pretty certain that had it not been for their exertions on that day,
we should not now have had possession of the French Capital, with the aid of
part of the Prussians at the close of the day, and which came very seasonably,
not only to complete a hard day's work, but to follow a routed enemy which
they did to perfection. I went over a part of the field of Battle next morning
where we had principly been engaged, with the view of getting removed such of
the wounded of the Greys as remained, and also to bury the officers, the former
had all been removed, and the latter I saw put under ground as well as we could.
Poor Carruthers died next day of his wounds. The men wounded say that they
received their wounds after they were taken prisoners, this from their horses
being killed, from which it would appear that the French expected no quarter
was to be given on either side: the field is far beyond my power to describe, it
was literally covered with men and horses, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I beg you will excuse this horrid scrawl as I find that I am not competent
to give even a faint description of this bloody battle.</p>

<p>"Clark had a horse killed under him and himself wounded. Poole had a
horse killed and himself for some time a prisoner. Verner a horse shot through
the head and himself through the shoulder and apparently by the same ball.
Wemyss a horse shot. Cheney had five horses (only one his own, and the rest
troopers), his own died next day. My horse shot through the shoulder and my
cloak like a ridle from musket balls. Indeed only two officers escaped without
being touched either themselves or horse.</p>

<p>"As Colonel Clark is now likely to succeed to the command of the
Regiment."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Weir, of the Scots Greys, was pay-sergeant of his troop, and as
such might have been excused serving in action, and perhaps he should not have
been forward, but on such a day as Waterloo he requested to be allowed to
charge with the Regiment. In one of the charges he fell mortally wounded, and
was left on the field. Corporal Scot, of the same regiment (who lost a leg)
asserts that when the field was searched for the wounded and slain, the body of
Sergeant Weir was found with his name written on his forehead by his own
hand dipped in his own blood. This his comrade said he was supposed to have
done that his body might be found and known, and that it might not be
imagined he had disappeared with the money of the Troop."</p></div>

<p>The Greys landed in England on January 12th, 1816, and on the
14th joined the depot at Canterbury.</p>

<p>The establishment was soon ordered to be reduced to 544 all told.</p>

<p>In June, 1817, they marched from Canterbury to Scotland.</p>

<p>In July, 1818, they went to Ireland.</p>

<p>Returning to England, the Regiment landed at Bristol in May,
1821, and marched to Birmingham and Coventry. In July, it went
to London to attend the coronation of King George IV. In August,
the establishment was further reduced to 6 troops.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1822 the Regiment marched to Scotland.</p>

<p>On August 15th, George IV. landed at Leith, where he was
received by the Regiment, and the Regiment had the honour of
attending upon him during his stay in Scotland. In July, 1823, the
Regiment left Scotland, and was at first stationed at Newcastle-on-Tyne
and Carlisle. In the summer of 1824, it was at Manchester
and Nottingham; in May, 1825, at Coventry, Birmingham, and
Northampton. In June, it was quartered near London&mdash;at Hammersmith
and Turnham Green. On June 28th, the Greys, together
with other cavalry and a brigade of Horse Artillery, were reviewed
on Hounslow Heath by the Duke of York. The Greys now marched
to Norwich and Ipswich. Early in 1826 they went to Ireland. In
May, 1830, they embarked at Cork for Bristol, and marched into
quarters at Dorchester, Weymouth, and Trowbridge; from whence
they proceeded, in November, to Windsor.</p>

<p>On November 9th, Queen Adelaide inspected two squadrons in
the riding-house at Pimlico. Before the end of November, the
Regiment marched to Maidstone.</p>

<p>In 1831, they were at Brighton, Chichester, and Warley. In
1832, in Birmingham. In 1833, in York. In 1834, they marched
to Edinburgh. In 1835, they were quartered at Leeds. In May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
1836, they embarked at Liverpool for Ireland. The rest of the
movements of the Regiment are, roughly: Brighton, 1841, Exeter, 1842 and 1843; Ipswich,
1844; Edinburgh, 1845; Dundalk, 1846; Clonmel, 1847; Athlone,
1848 and 1849; Longford, 1850; Canterbury, 1851; Dorchester,
1852; Birmingham, 1853; Nottingham, 1854.</p>

<p>Now next, in regard to the Crimea, it would be absurd to try to
adjust or supplement the following records. They are of unique
interest. The Greys reached the Crimea on September 24th, 1854.</p>

<p>A folio volume, the property of the Regiment, lettered&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Historic Register, 2nd Dragoons," and inside, "from August 10th, 1854":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The average strength of the regiment during the period they have been
in Turkey and the Crimea has been 223. They arrived in Turkey on
August 10th, 1855, disembarking at Kulalie on the Adriatic side of the
Bosphorus. Kulalie is about seven miles north of Scutari. There I joined
the regiment from Varna on August 31st, having been transferred from the
medical charge of the 93rd Highlanders to that of the Scots Greys on
September 22nd.</p>

<p>"The corps embarked on board the <em>Himalaya</em> for the Crimea, and
disembarked at the Katchu on September 24th, joining the allied army at
the time it was executing its flank march on Balaclava. That night they
bivouacked on the Belbee, and the following day came into collision with the
enemy at the affair of Mackenzie's Farm, when they succeeded in capturing a
quantity of baggage, ammunition, stores, &amp;c.; also in capturing and destroying
a portion of the rear guard of Prince Menchikoff's army, and without suffering
the loss of a man on their part. The following day they were present at the
capture of Balaclava, and bivouacked on the plains in front of that village.
On October 25th they took a prominent part in the action in front of
Balaclava, when the Russian army attempted to force that position, and they
defeated and utterly routed a large body of the enemy's cavalry which had
attacked and surrounded them in the proportion of three to one. After this
'feat of arms' they were led into the cross fires of the enemy's batteries, being
ordered up to the support of the Light Cavalry Brigade their memorable but
disastrous charge. On this occasion they sustained some severe injury, the
wounds inflicted being nearly all of a serious nature caused by round shot,
shell, grape and rifle balls.</p>

<p>"The loss of the regiment in this action amounted to 2 men killed and
54 wounded, several of whom subsequently died of their wounds, and 4 officers
wounded. The three first men who fell were mortally wounded by rifle balls
in covering the retreat of the Turks from the redoubts....</p></div>

<p>"Nothing of importance occurred from this period up to November 5th,
when the sanguinary battle of Inkerman took place.</p>

<p>"The Greys were drawn up on the heights in reserve, and did not come
into collision with the enemy.</p>

<p>"The regiment remained on the heights before Sebastopol till the beginning
of December, when owing to the inclemency of the weather, having sustained
considerable losses both in men and horses, they were ordered down to the
sheltered valley close to the village of Kadekai, where they passed the winter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All this while, the string of the 300 red coats were forming Scarlett's
slender first line in the valley beneath, and they seemed to be playing parade.
At the moment I speak of, the troop officers of the Greys were still facing their
men; and their drill rules, it seems, had declared that they must continue to
do so till the major of the regiment should at length bring them round by
giving the order, Eyes right! Not yet would the Greys consent to be
disturbed in their ceremonies by the descending column.</p>

<div class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 20%">*</span><span style="margin-left: 20%">*</span><span style="margin-left: 20%">*</span><span style="margin-left: 20%">*</span></div>

<p>"A singular friendship had long subsisted between the Scots Greys and the
Inniskilling Dragoons. It dated from the time of that famous brigade in
which three cavalry regiments were so brought together as to express by their
aggregate title the union of the three kingdoms, yet offer a sample of each (the
'Royals' represented England)....</p>

<p>"The friendship between the Scottish and the Irish regiment had the ardour
of personal friendship, and a tenacity not liable to be relaxed by mere death;
for a regiment great in history bears so far a resemblance to the immortal gods
as to be old in power and glory, yet have always the freshness of youth. Long
intervals of years often passed in which the Greys and the Inniskillings
remained parted by distance, but whenever it became known that by some new
change of quarters the two regiments would once more be brought together
there used to be great joy and preparation.... When last the sworn
friends were together in what they might deign to call fighting they were under
the field glass of the great Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Then, as now, the Greys charged in the first line, and on the left of the
Inniskillings.</p>

<p>"Of the two comrade regiments each had its distinguishing characteristics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
The Inniskillings, with still some remaining traces in their corps of the old
warlike Orange enthusiasm, were eager, fiery, impetuous. The Scots Greys,
with a great power of self-restraint, were yet liable to be wrought upon by
their native inborn desire for a fight till it raged like a consuming passion.</p>

<p>"From the exceeding tenacity of their nature, it resulted that the combative
impulses, when long baffled by circumstances, were cumulative in their effect;
and the events of that day&mdash;the capture of British guns under the eyes of our
horsemen&mdash;the marching, the counter-marching, the marching again, without
ever striking a blow, and finally, the dainty dressing of ranks under the eyes of
the enemy's host&mdash;all these antecedent trials of patience had been heating and
still heating the furnace by the very barriers which kept down the flame....</p>

<p>"The Greys were led by Colonel Darby Griffith; and the two squadron
leaders who followed him were Major Clarke on the right, and Captain
Williams on the left. Handley, Hunter, Buchanan, and Sutherland were the
four troop leaders of the regiment; the Adjutant was Lieutenant Miller; the
serre-files were Boyd, Nugent, and Lenox Prendergast. And to these,
though he did not then hold the Queen's Commission, I add the name of John
Wilson, now a cornet, and the acting adjutant of the regiment, for he took a
signal part in the fight."</p></div>

<p>"A soldier who was in the midst of the terrible conflict at Balaclava,
and who escaped unhurt, gives the following account of what he felt and saw
in that deadly struggle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'We charged. Oh, God! I cannot describe it; they were so superior in
numbers; they "out-flanked" us, and we were in the middle of them. I never
certainly felt less fear in my life than I did at that time; and I hope God will
forgive me, for I felt more like a devil than a man. We fought our way out of
them as only Englishmen can fight; and the 4th, 5th, and 6th were there up
with us. I escaped without a scratch, thank God, though I was covered with
blood; my horse was not even wounded. But oh! the work of slaughter
that then began&mdash;'twas truly awful; but I suppose it was necessary. We cut
them down like sheep, and they did not seem to have power to resist. The
plain is covered and covered with dead Russians, and, of course, we left some
of our poor comrades on the field. We only lost two and about seven
wounded. Well, when we had finished this lot we thought of going home to
breakfast; but no, they (the enemy) had some guns over the hills that Lord
Raglan sent word were to be charged, and captured at any cost. So off we
went again. They received us very quietly into their ground&mdash;Lord Lucan
leading the Heavies, and Lord Cardigan the Light Brigade. The Light
charged first this time, took the guns, cut down the gunners, and then, when
they thought all was right, they were met by thousands of Cossacks, who had
been in ambush. The Royals, the Greys, the 4th, 5th, and 6th, now charged
again. The butchering was repeated; when suddenly a cross front and rear
fire opened upon us from the hills&mdash;cannon, rifles, and file firing.</p></div>

were both killed on the spot. We hacked our way out of it as well as we
could, but were obliged to leave the guns. Colonel Yorke had his leg broken,
and all the officers in the front rank were wounded. The Heavy Brigade have
not lost many men; but, sad to tell, out of about 600 of the Light Brigade that
went into the field, only 400 came out; but this is nothing to what the enemy
suffered.'"</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>The following is here set up in type direct from the handwriting
of a retired officer of the Greys, giving his own Crimean recollections.
He is modest of his name appearing; and at first intended
that I should write my own account, after listening to his remarks;
but I am glad to say that I induced him to make his own record, and
I have even ignored his request that I would "edit" his writing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"War in Europe had ceased for 40 years, when in the reign of Queen
Victoria peace was broken, and troops from the United Kingdom were being
sent out to concentrate eventually in Turkey at the call of that Power in its
resistance to Russian aggression.</p>

<p>"The Greys were not included at first when the expedition started, though
cavalry (Heavy and Light) supplied regiments for the force concentrated at
Varna under Lord Raglan the commander-in-chief of the British Army allied
to the French in the joint expedition.</p>

<p>"The Greys were naturally disappointed at receiving no order to embark
at first, but when it was decided by the Government that an invasion of the
Crimea was to be undertaken in July, 1854, they received orders to start at
once for Constantinople, where they were quartered in the cavalry barracks at
Kulalie on the Bosphorus for several weeks during the time the flotilla was in
preparation for crossing the Black Sea.</p>

<p>"At last word came that it had embarked for the Crimea, and with it as far
as cavalry was concerned only light cavalry regiments were included at that time.</p>

<p>"Very shortly, however, the transport <em>Himalaya</em>, which had originally
brought out the regiment from England, appeared in the Bosphorus; and
immediately embarked the Reg<sup>t</sup> for service in the Crimea.</p>

<p>"It so happened that as the <em>Himalaya</em> was passing the Fortress of
Sebastopol the Russians were engaged in sinking ships to block the harbour
to our fleet; a momentous decision! as it proved.</p>

<p>"A remarkable scene then presented itself. First came the British Fleet,
then the French Fleet, covering the flank of the allied army in full march
towards the fortress&mdash;the French regiments being nearest to the sea were
sighted first, then the British more inland, the whole army (though the fact was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
yet unknown) flushed with victory of the Alma River which they left that
morning behind.</p>

<p>"The Greys in fact joined the army at the Alma River where they were
met by Lord Burghersh, Lord Raglan's Aide-de-Camp, who gave the first intimation
of the Battle and suggested the steamer should drop down to the next
river, the Katcha, and there disembark at any rate a squadron if possible before
dark, so that it might watch for a force expected from Eupatoria to attack the
rear of the army.</p>

<p>"This was done and the bulk of the Reg<sup>t</sup> disembarked the following
morning.</p>

<p>"At the next river, the Belbec, the Greys from being with the rearguard
was moved right through the English and French armies, bivouacked near the
great high road to Sebastopol so as to become the advanced guard of the whole
army, for they were the freshest troops just arrived from England, and 'turned
out' as if for a Horse Guards Parade!</p>

<p>"It was a strange scene; as soon as the French caught sight of the bearskin
caps they began to cheer lustily, and as the Reg<sup>t</sup> neared the Highlanders of
the British army, hung on cheering and asking for news from home; the French
meanwhile calling out 'Voila de la Cavalrie, voila des Grenadiers a cheval.'</p>

<p>"What followed is worth mentioning in some little detail, since the Greys
was the only Heavy Cavalry Reg<sup>t</sup> as yet landed in the Crimea, and a special
job fell to their lot that day. The Reg<sup>t</sup> being the advanced guard of the
Allied Forces moving straight to the North side of the fortress a singular and
most important change of direction had to be made quite suddenly when the
Russian outposts had been reached.</p>

<p>"This movement is known as 'the flank march,' undertaken in consequence
of the allied commanders' acceptance of a memorandum by Sir John Burgoyne,
the distinguished officer of Engineers, pointing out that the South side of
the fortress was practically undefended, and that if the Allied Forces could
successfully move round, the North side might be left to itself.</p>

<p>"Sir John Burgoyne's memorandum, dated the day after the battle of the
Alma, is given in full in an instructive volume by Sir John Adye, entitled 'A
Review of the Crimean War, published by Hurst &amp; Blackett, 1860.' On
arrival at the Belbec river the allied commanders adopted the plan proposed in
the able memorandum alluded to.</p>

<p>"In order to strike the main road which leads into the interior of the
country down the Mackenzie heights towards Sebastopol and to the plains of
Balaclava, the allies who, on the morning of the 25 September, were on the
heights above the Belbec, had for some distance to march in a south-easterly
direction through thick woods, in which there was only a slight track. On the
same morning Prince Menschikoff, ignorant of the change, and doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
conceiving that the plans of the allied generals were fully decided upon the attack
on the <em>North</em> side, was moving a force, a considerable force, by the same main
road up the Mackenzie heights and into the country towards Bacskiverai, with
the intention, probably, when his troops had somewhat regained their confidence,
and when they had been joined by reinforcements, to return and attack the
Anglo-French army in its rear.</p>

<p>"Thus, on the 25th September the two hostile forces were unconsciously
moving in two lines which intersected each other at a point close to the crest of
the heights. Consequently, to the surprise of both, the advanced guard of the
one suddenly found itself in the presence of the rearguard of the other. The
Russian rearguard after standing for a moment dispersed into the wood, taking
pot-shots at the Greys, who were forming up on the first available open space;
as this could not be submitted to it became necessary, as there were no infantry
present, to dismount a portion of the Reg<sup>t</sup> to skirmish in the wood against the
irritating Russian Infantry, who, after firing at the horsemen, threw themselves
down and pretended to be dead.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward B. Hamley, writing in 1855, in his book, 'The Campaign in
the Crimea, London, Blackwood,' alludes to having been present at this incident,
saying, 'Some of the Scots Greys dismounting went skirmishing through the
wood, and about a dozen Russians throwing themselves down and pretending to
be dead, rose after they were past and fired on them, for which discreditable ruse
they were, as they deserved to be, all put to death.'</p>

<p>"This was too much for Jock and he proceeded to use his carbine, not
however before consulting the Sergeant-Major, (so the regimental story goes,)
in the words 'Sairgent-Major, shall I shoot 'em?' and the prompt reply came,
'Most unquestionably!'</p>

<p>"In the meantime an excited Staff Officer came to the Colonel of the
Reg<sup>t</sup> asking for 'six determined men' to gallop down the ravine road and
upset the foremost Russian carriage so as to secure the convoy. Again the story
goes that the Colonel promptly replied by ordering 'from the right number off
six!' and away they went with the happiest result&mdash;amongst other loot there
was Menschikoff's carriage in which was stored a lot of champagne which it is
needless to say was broached without much delay.</p>

<p>"In the carriage was a Colonel of high rank who evidently had not
forgotten to use the contents of the Prince's carriage.</p>

<p>"He was transferred as a prisoner to the Fleet later on&mdash;where he remained
till at Petersburg the authorities consented to release Lord Dunkellin who had
been taken prisoner and whose exchange was conditional on the return of this
officer. There are stories extant about his subsequent fate.</p>

<p>"This casual encounter was so far useful for the moment, that it must have
rather mystified the enemy as to the places of the allies, but Lord Raglan feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the importance of regaining the coast, his army being for the time scattered for
miles along a thin line, at once retraced his steps and continued his march by the
steep road down the Mackenzie heights: and towards sunset the light and first
divisions streamed across the plain followed shortly after by the 2nd Division,
and subsequently by the French Army bearing with them in a litter Marshall
St. Arnaud in a dying condition. He died, a few days after the town of
Balaclava was occupied, on board a French Ship of War.</p>

<p>"Sir John Adye who was present on the occasion describes 'the Flank
march' as the one great strategic success of the whole War.</p>

<p>"'The fortunate result of the flank march, by giving the allied generals
possession of the excellent, though diminutive, harbour of Balaclava, and thus
affording them a safe communication with their fleets, relieved them of one of
the anxieties hitherto attending their movements, and enabled them to devote
all their attention to the one great object of the expedition&mdash;the capture of
Sebastopol.'</p>

<p>"Considering the immense importance of this little harbour, the only depot
of the English Army and considering its isolated position, it being several miles
from the plateau on which the infantry of the army was encamped its defence
was a cause of keen anxiety.</p>

<p>"It can scarcely be supposed that a few Turkish redoubts with the 93rd
Highlanders under Sir Colin Campbell was a suitable defence for such a place&mdash;and
yet what was there besides the Cavalry encamped in the plain?</p>

<p>"The Cavalry it is true had been reinforced by the arrival of the heavy
Cavalry Regt<sup>s</sup> (since the flank march described above) which had been left
at Varna on the other side of the Black Sea: and their performance on the
occasion of the coming battle is perhaps as well known as any incident during
the Crimean War. But the battle was not merely a dash and a ride, and to
understand what took place requires some sifting of the circumstances so as to
arrive at a definite notion of the <em>day's work</em>.</p>

<p>"After the middle of October the first reinforcements for Prince
Menschikoff's army having arrived the enemy had been observed for some days
hovering in the neighbourhood of Balaclava and the troops there were constantly
kept on the alert.</p>

<p>"At day break on the 25th October General Liprandi with 20,000
infantry, supported by a strong force of cavalry and about 40 guns made a
determined attack and in the words of Sir E. Hamley the battle commenced by
'the Russian guns on the eminences and in the valley opened a cannonade on
the outposts held by the Turks. A troop of Horse Artillery and a field battery
supported by the Scots Greys were ordered up to Balaclava to the slopes between
the outposts and found themselves opposed to the fire of several field batteries
and service guns of position which covered an advance of infantry against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
hills on the right. As the troop was armed with only 6-pounders, it and the
field battery were quite over-matched, both in metal and in numbers; nevertheless
our artillery maintained the contest till its ammunition was exhausted, when
it retired, having lost a good many horses and a few men besides Maude the
Captain of the troop, who was severely wounded by a shell which burst in his
horse.'</p>

<p>"Time had still to be given to the infantry to arrive from the plateau
miles away, therefore the squadrons had to be withdrawn very <em>gradually</em>, all the
time being under the fire of Liprandi's guns.</p>

<p>"Thus opened the Battle of Balaklava, the engagement continued through
the day with separate incidents, with intervals between them, and marked by
singular interest. Sir Edward Hamley, after speaking with measured words of
one of these incidents which immediately preceded the well-known cavalry charge
of the Heavy Brigade, says, 'There was something almost theatrical in the grandeur
of this portion of the spectacle; the French stationed on the heights, and the
English passing along them, looked down, as if from the benches of an amphitheatre,
on the two bodies of cavalry meeting in mortal shock on the level
grassy plain, which enclosed on every side by lofty mountains would have been
a fit arena for a tournament of giants.'"</p></div>

<p class="center"><em>Lord Rosebery, at the unveiling of the Memorial, spoke as follows</em>:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

<span class="smcap">Colonel Coventry Williams, and Gentlemen of the Scots Greys</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>You have done me a great honour in asking me to unveil this memorial, and, if I may say so, you have done a wise
thing in erecting it. You have raised to the memory of your comrades a memorial in the Capital of Scotland, under
the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, in the noblest street in the world. But, as things are, it must be a memorial not merely
to the dead, to those who have fallen, but to that proud and illustrious regiment which you represent, and which, in the
inscrutable dispensation of the higher powers, we are so soon to lose for ever from our midst. For the Scots Greys are
bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. They were raised, indeed, in these Lowlands of ours under circumstances which
do not so much elicit our sympathy as the events of their later history, though they were raised by a Lothian man, Colonel
Dalziel of Binns; as they were raised for the purpose of harrying the Covenanters, who represented the backbone of the
character and the history of Scotland in the reign of the last two Stuarts. However, they were soon to be called to higher
duties than those of civil war. They served gloriously under Marlborough in the Low Countries; they fought all through
the wars of the eighteenth century; they captured a standard at Dettingen; and yet the time of their full glory had not
come. It was at Waterloo that their chance came; it was in that tremendous charge when, with the Inniskillings and
the Royals, they rode down masses of French infantry&mdash;in that tremendous charge where Sergeant-Major Ewart, one of
your non-commissioned officers, wrested an eagle from the French, and cut down successively three gallant Frenchmen
who stood to defend it. Later on that day they came to the assistance of a small body of the 92nd Highlanders, and they
together, to the cry of "Scotland for Ever," annihilated a greatly superior column of the enemy which was opposed to
them. And, again, as the shades of evening drew on, they joined in the unrelenting pursuit of the broken enemy until
darkness put an end to the engagement. Surely no regiment ever had a prouder day than that. It need not be fiction,
but may well be believed, that Napoleon himself recognised their achievement, and honoured their heroic courage. It is
not, then, in vain, that to this day, and for all time to come, the Scots Greys bear with them the symbol of the Eagle and
the name of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Then they were called to serve in the Crimea. We speak in the presence of a distinguished Russian officer; but
the brave honour the brave, and he will allow me to recall, even in his presence, that charge of the Heavy Brigade at
Balaclava, partially forgotten in the more startling achievement of the Light Brigade, but still splendid and memorable,
when the Heavy Brigade, headed once more by the Scots Greys and the Inniskillings, rode through the dense masses of
the enemy. It was at the close of that day that Sir Colin Campbell, afterwards Lord Clyde, rode up to the regiment and
with bared head said to them: "Scots Greys, I am sixty-one, but were I a young man I would ask for nothing better than
the honour of serving in your ranks." Then came the South African War. That was a very different campaign. It was
war carried on in vast solitudes, against small bodies of men&mdash;against an enemy that was almost always invisible. No such
heart-breaking or harassing work for a soldier can be conceived. It afforded no room for the splendid achievements of
Waterloo and the Crimea. It required perseverance, patience, and vigilance, almost as much as courage; but is not cold
courage&mdash;cold-blooded courage prolonged through long years&mdash;at least as meritorious as the hot, warm-blooded courage
of the onset? The British Army in South Africa fought under harassing conditions. They fought a new warfare; they
fought hardship and disease; and they fought under the discouragement of military operations carried on with patience
through long years to a tardy but triumphant result.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I was with the Scots Greys at their last dinner in this city; it was a cheerful dinner, but it was not glad
or triumphant. We met under the shadow of a humiliating reverse; we knew that, humanly speaking, we could not
expect that all who were then present would return to us again. We knew at any rate that all were about to face the
unknown, and we then resolved and declared that evening that having put our hands to this thing we would see it
through; that we would muddle through somehow, and somehow or other we did muddle through. Some of those who
were there that night did not return, and it is to their memory that we erect this memorial to-day.</p>

<p>Honour to the unreturning brave, the brave who will return no more. We shall not see their faces again. In the
service of their Sovereign and their country they have undergone the sharpness of death, and sleep their eternal sleep
thousands of miles away in the green solitudes of South Africa. Their places, their comrades, their saddles will know them
no more, for they will never return to us as we knew them. But in a nobler and a higher sense, have they not returned
to us to-day? They return to us with a message of duty, of courage, of patriotism. They return to us with a memory of
high duty faithfully performed. They return to us with the inspiration of their example. Peace, then, to their dust.
Honour to their memory. Scotland for ever!</p></div>

Free State was occupied. This is a record of which any
army may well be proud&mdash;a record which could not have
been achieved except by earnest, well-disciplined men,
determined to do their duty, and to surmount whatever
difficulties or dangers might be encountered. Exposed to
extreme heat by day, bivouacking under heavy rain, marching
long distances, not infrequently with reduced rations, the
endurance, cheerfulness, and gallantry displayed by all ranks
are beyond praise; and Lord Roberts feels sure that neither
H.M. the Queen nor the British nation will be unmindful
of the efforts made by the Force to uphold the honour of
their country.</p>

<p>"The Field-Marshal desires especially to refer to the
fortitude and heroic spirit with which the wounded have
borne their sufferings.</p>

<p>"Owing to the great extent of country over which
modern battles have to be fought, it is not always possible to
afford immediate relief to those who are struck down. Many
hours have indeed elapsed before some of the wounded could
be attended to, but not a word or murmur of complaint has
been uttered. The anxiety of all when succour came was
that their comrades should be cared for first. In assuring
every officer and man how much he appreciates their efforts
in the past, Lord Roberts is confident that in the future they
will continue to show the same resolution and soldierly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
qualities, and to lay down their lives if need be (as so many
brave men have already done) in order to assure that the war
in South Africa may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion."</p></div>

<h3><a id="UNIFORM_AND_ARMS">UNIFORM AND ARMS.</a></h3>

<p>In February, 1683, General Dalzell, "finding that he cannot be
provided in this kingdom with as much cloth of one colour as will be
clothes to the regiment of dragoons," obtained from the Privy Council
of Scotland a licence permitting the cloth manufacturing company at
Newmills "to import 2,536 ells of stone-grey cloth from England, for
clothing the said regiment of dragoons."</p>

<p>The men wore iron helmets and very high boots.</p>

<p>Each trooper seems to have been armed with a matchlock musket
and a bayonet, and wore a collar of bandoliers. There were, however,
twelve men in each troop not thus armed, but carrying halberds and
pistols. These same twelve probably also carried hand grenades.</p>

<p>By an order dated February 21st, 1687, Dragoons were ordered
to have "snaphanse musquets, strapt, with bright barrels of three foote
eight inches long, cartouche boxes, bayonets, granado pouches, bucketts,
and hammer-hatchetts."</p>

Regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Boots.</em>&mdash;Of jacked leather.</p>

<p>"<em>Cloaks.</em>&mdash;Of scarlet cloth, with a blue collar, and lined with blue

<p>In the volume belonging to the Regiment, and dated 1759, are
the following entries relating to dress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>22 January.</em>&mdash;A stiver to be stopped from each man for having his hatt
cocked, which the Major hopes the regiment won't be against paying, as it is for
their own advantage.</p>

<p>"<em>25 January.</em>&mdash;The troops to send the bread waggons for their hatts and
gloves on Monday next, and no man to presume to alter the cock, otherwise it
will be done over again, and he be obliged to pay every time it is not in shape."</p></div>

<p>In 1764 further changes were made. The Regiment was ordered
to be remounted with long-tailed horses! The officers and men were
directed to wear epaulettes on the left shoulder instead of aiguillettes.
The colour of the waistcoats and breeches was changed from blue to
white, and the button-holes were ordered to be plain. At the same
time, jacked leather boots were replaced by others of a lighter description,
and the silver binding on the officers' coats was discontinued.</p>

<p>On December 19th, 1768, appeared another royal warrant
ordering the Regiment to wear black bearskin caps, with the thistle
within the circle of St. Andrew, and the motto, "Nemo me impune
lacessit," on the front of the cap.</p>

<p>In 1788, an order was issued for sword-belts to be worn suspended
across the right shoulder, instead of being fastened round the waist;
also to wear an epaulette, or strap, on the right shoulder uniform with
that on the left.</p>

<p>In 1808, an order was issued for the men's hair to be cut short,
instead of being plaited and tied up and powdered. In 1811, an order
was made for the men's coats to be made in future shorter in the skirts,
and broad yellow lace, down the front and round the skirts and cuffs,
was introduced in the place of the narrow white lace hitherto worn
across the breast, arms, and skirts. Also plush breeches were to be
worn instead of leather.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1812, web breeches and grey cloth overalls
were introduced, and a valice (<em>sic</em>) of scarlet cloth was substituted for
the leather saddle bags. The battle of Waterloo, so famous in the
Regiment's history, is commemorated by the badge of an eagle displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
on the guidons, and the word "Waterloo" borne on the guidons and
on the grenadier caps.</p>

<p>In the Official Regulations for Officers' Dress, dated 1846,
page 109:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Second or Royal North British Dragoons have permission to wear
a bear-skin cap with a white hackle feather, nine inches long, according to
regimental pattern."</p></div>

<p>In the Official Regulations of 1864 for Officers, at p. 57:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Head dress for the 2nd Dragoons, a bear-skin cap, with a gilt thistle on
the front, and on the left side a gilt grenade to receive the plume bearing the
Royal arms, above the badge of St. Andrew, and the word 'Waterloo' below.</p>

<p>"Plume, a white hackle feather, nine inches long."</p></div>

<p>At page 42 of the Officers' Dress Regulations, dated 1894, is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Cap for 2nd Dragoons (Scots Greys) black bearskin, 10 inches high;

<p>ALEXANDER ABERCROMBY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cornet, 16 August, 1799. Promoted Lieutenant, in 52nd Foot,
19 March, 1800.</p></div>

<p>SIR RALPH ABERCROMBY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Colonel, 2 November, 1796. Died on or before 16 May, 1801.</p>

<p>The General who shares with Sir John Moore, the credit
of renewing the ancient discipline and military reputation of
the British soldier, was born at Menstry near Tullibody, in
October, 1734. Educated at Rugby, and afterwards studied law
at Edinburgh and Leipzig. In 1756 made a Cornet in 3rd
Dragoon Guards. In 1758 he went with his regiment to
Germany, where it formed part of the English force under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, the victor of Minden. Lieutenant,
1760. Captain, 1762. In 1767 he married Miss Menzies, with
whom he lived very happily. Major, 1770. Lieutenant-Colonel,
1773. Became M.P. for county of Clackmannan, but soon gave
up Parliamentary life. War broke out with France, he was made
a Major-General, and ordered to Flanders with a Brigade. First
made his mark at Furnes, commanded the storming column at
the siege of Valenciennes, and was publicly thanked by the Duke
of York for his conduct at Roubaix. Returned to England in
1795, and made a Knight of the Bath. In November, 1795,
sailed for the West Indies with 15,000 men, to reduce the
French Sugar Islands. In 1799 he was despatched with 10,000
men, to attack Holland. On 20 October in an attack on Bergen,
he had two horses shot under him.... 24 October, 1800, he
was ordered to proceed with all his troops, to Egypt to expel or
capture the French Army left there by Napoleon.... 27
December, he cast anchor in the bay of Marmorice. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
he waited 6 weeks, receiving some slight reinforcements, and
discovering that the Turks were quite useless as allies. But while
waiting he looked after his soldiers' health, and practised disembarkments
until the whole force thoroughly understood how to
promptly disembark, and every man knew his place in his boat....
On 2 March he anchored in Aboukir Bay.... In the end
Menou was beaten back with immense loss, including 3 generals
killed, while the English loss was only 1464 killed and wounded.
Among the latter was Sir Ralph Abercromby, who riding in front
in his usual reckless manner, was wounded in the thigh by a
musket ball. He was carried to the Foudroyant, the flagship.
"What is it you have placed under my head?" asked the
wounded general. "Only a soldier's blanket," answered the aide
de camp. "Only a soldier's blanket; make haste and return it to
him at once."</p>

<p>He died on board the flagship on 28 March.</p>

<p>No biography would be complete which did not notice his
extreme shortsightedness, almost blindness, nor yet without
noticing the singular sweetness and purity of his domestic life,
which made all who came across him, from the Duke of York,
whom he eclipsed, to Lord Camden, with whom he quarrelled,
acknowledge the charm of his society.</p></div>

<p>Cornet, 31 May, 1715.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>ANDREW AGNEW.</p>

Captain-Lieutenant, 8 February, 1712-13. Captain, 16
September, 1715.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Agnew, fifth Baronet of Lochnau, twelfth and
last of the hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway, was born in 1687.
He joined Marlborough's army as a volunteer immediately after
the battle of Blenheim.... He fought bravely at Ramillies,
Oudenarde, and Malplaquet. At the Peace of Utrecht he was
reduced as Captain on half-pay of the Scots Greys. Soon after
he eloped with a kinswoman, the daughter of Captain Thomas
Agnew, of the same regiment. This lady, to whom he was
married in London, bore him 18 children. She survived her
husband, and died at the age of 87. At the time of the
rebellion of 1715-16, the young laird of Lochnau was on full
pay in Colonel Pocock's, which was disbanded in Ireland in 1718,
when he was removed to the 21st Royal Scots Fusiliers, with
which corps he served upwards of a quarter of a century,
becoming Lieutenant-Colonel in 1740, and commanding it with
distinction at the battle of Dettingen. He held Brigade
commands under the Duke of Cumberland in Flanders, at
Bruges, Ghent, and Ostend, and at the head of his Scots Fusiliers
accompanied the army sent to Scotland in 1746, when he was
detached to Blair Castle, and made a gallant stand there. In
1756 he became Major-General, and Lieutenant-General in 1759.
Sir Walter Scott describes him as a soldier of the old school, stiff
and formal in manner, brave to the last degree, and something of
a humourist.</p></div>

<p>Sir Bryce Blair, of Blair, afterwards knighted by Charles I.,
married in 1618 Marian, daughter of Walter Dundas, of Dundas.
His son, John, died without issue, and was succeeded by his uncle,
John Blair, who married Lady Jean Cunningham, daughter of
William, eighth Earl of Glencairn, and dying in 1662, was succeeded
by his son, William Blair, of Blair. This gentleman was
named by the restoration government of Scotland a member of the
Commission in Ayrshire for holding courts on the Covenanters,
but he early joined the revolution party.... Having raised a
troop of horse in support of King William, he marched with it
into Perthshire. News of this reaching Viscount Dundee, then in
arms in Atholl for King James, he determined to surprise them,
and marching by night towards Perth, he entered the city
unawares early the next morning, seized the laird of Blair and
the laird of Pollock who was with him, and two other officers,
in their beds. He carried them off prisoners to the highlands,
where the laird of Blair died shortly afterwards. He had married
Lady Margaret Hamilton, daughter of William, 2nd Duke of
Hamilton. Their son, William Blair of Blair, was a commissioner
of supply for the county of Ayr in the convention
parliament which met in 1689. He married Magdalene, daughter
of James Campbell. Their son John predeceased him unmarried,
and was succeeded by his sister Magdalene, who married William
Scott, and had a son William, her heir. The heiress of Blair is
supposed to have died before 1715, and Mr. Scott, her widower,
who had assumed the name and arms of Blair, married secondly
Catherine Tait, of Edinburgh. Their eldest son, Hamilton,
became Major in the Greys.</p></div>

<p>"He entered the army as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Dragoons

at the hard-fought battle of Malplaquet, on 11 September, 1709.
In this battle the Scots Greys were stationed in front of the
right of the allied line, under the command of Prince Eug&egrave;ne,
and when the obstinate resistance of the French made the issue
of the battle doubtful, Campbell, though he had been ordered
not to move, suddenly charged with his dragoons right through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the enemie's line and back again. The success of this charge
determined the battle in that quarter, and on the following day

1749.</p></div>

battle of Fellinghausen, and then, in 1762, in the expedition to
Cuba. The Seven Years' War over, he became a deep student
of his profession, and attended every year man&#339;uvres of the
French, Prussian, or Austrian armies. In 1770 he was promoted
Major. In 1775 he purchased the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of
the 12th Light Dragoons. In 1778 Quartermaster-General in
Ireland. In 1781 promoted Colonel. In 1782 made Lieutenant-Colonel
of the 2nd Irish Horse. In 1788 he published his
valuable work "The Principles of Military Movements." In
1790 he was promoted Major-General, and in 1791 made Colonel
of the 22nd Regiment. In June, 1792, were issued&mdash;Rules and
Regulations for the Formation, Field Exercises, and Movements
of His Majesty's Forces. These were drawn up by Dundas, and
issued officially. "Rules and Regulations for the Cavalry," were
also, at once, issued under similar conditions; but, in this case, he
had been largely aided by the experience of Sir James Stewart
Denham (also of the Greys). He commanded a brigade of
Cavalry at Tournay, on 22 May, 1794. Next, he fought the
battles of Geldermalsen and Tuyl. In 1795 he was made Colonel
of the 7th Light Dragoons, Quartermaster-General in 1796....
In 1801 he was made Colonel of the Greys and Governor of
Fort George, in the place of Sir Ralph Abercromby. In 1802
promoted General. Commander-in-Chief, 1809 to 1811. In
1813, Colonel of the 1st Dragoon Guards. Died, 18 February,
1820.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Bunbury recorded:&mdash;"Dundas was a tall, spare man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
crabbed and austere, dry in his looks and demeanour. He had
made his way from a poor condition (he told me himself that
he walked from Edinburgh to London to enter himself as a
fireworker in the artillery).... There was much care and valour
in that Scotchman."</p></div>

<p>PATRICK FERGUSON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cornet in the Lieutenant-Colonel's troop, in the Muster
signed at Kelso, 13 August, 1763. In Muster Roll ending
26 December, 1768, promoted to be a Lieutenant in the
70th Regiment. Born in 1744, his father being James
Ferguson of Pitfours, Aberdeenshire. He was taught fortification,
gunnery, &amp;c., in a military academy in London, and in
1759, before he was 15, was appointed a Cornet in the Greys.
On 2nd December, 1776, he obtained a patent for improvements
in Fire-arms. The patent covers several forms of breech action,
the use of sliding back sights, and also a peculiar mode of rifling.
After some successful public experiments at Woolwich, and
before the King at Windsor, the inventor returned to his regiment,
then quartered at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was allowed to form
a corps of riflemen with volunteers from regiments in America.
The men were armed with breech-loading rifled carbines. This
corps of riflemen, extended in front and supported by a corps of
rangers, did good service in covering General Knyphausen's
advance at the Battle of Brandywine, 11 September, 1777, when
Ferguson received a severe wound. 26 October, 1779, he was
made Major in the old 71st Highlanders, then in America. In
Carolina under Lord Cornwallis, he was again wounded severely.
At the fight of King's Mountain, on 9 October, 1780, he was
surprised and killed. The D. N. B. concludes: "Ferguson is
allowed by all to have been a generous, chivalrous soldier, but the
partisan warfare in which he was engaged gave rise to rancorous
feelings on both sides. It is alleged that indignities were offered
to his mangled corpse and great barbarities practised on the
wretched militiamen under him who were taken prisoners.
Unable to show other marks of respect to his memory, Ferguson's
brother officers published a notice of him in the form of a
monumental epitaph in the <cite>New York Gazette</cite>, 14 February,
1781."</p></div>

<p>JAMES GARDINER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24 February, 1707-8, Lieutenant in Captain William Crawford's
Additional Troop.</p>

<p>The above entry in the original manuscript "Army List" at
the Record Office was evidently unknown to the editors of the
"Dictionary of National Biography," who have been careful to
explain that the famous Colonel Gardiner killed at Prestonpans
had not served in the Greys.</p>

<p>In the same manuscript the Earl of Stair is recorded as Colonel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and this same William Crawford as Captain-Lieutenant commanding
the Colonel's own troop. In the next MS. list, of
about 1714, James Gardiner appears again.</p>

<p>The chief points in Gardiner's life must be taken from the
Rev. Dr. Doddridge's "Some remarkable passages in the Life of
the Hon. Colonel James Gardiner, who was slain at the battle of
Prestonpans, September 21, 1745." He was the son of Captain
Patrick Gardiner, of Torwood Head, Linlithgowshire, and was
born 10 January, 1687. At the early age of 14 he bore an
ensign's commission in a Scotch Regiment in the Dutch service
until 1702, when he received an Ensign's commission from
Queen Anne. At the age of 19, in the battle of Ramillies,
he received a wound in his mouth by a musket ball. "He was
of a party in the forlorn hope, and was commanded on what
seemed almost a desperate service, to dispossess the French of the
churchyard at Ramillies, where a considerable number of them
were posted to remarkable advantage. He planted his colours
on an advanced ground, and while he was calling to his men, he
received a shot into his mouth."</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton has rightly recorded Gardiner as a Lieutenant in
the Greys, and adds a note&mdash;"Master of the Horse to the Earl
of Stair when that nobleman was sent Ambassador to France in
1715. Appointed Major of the Earl of Stair's Regiment of
Dragoons (now the Inniskilling Dragoons), 14 January, 1717.
Lieutenant-Colonel of the same Regiment, 4 January, 1730.
Colonel of the Regiment now the 13th Hussars, 18 April, 1743."</p>

<p>On the 22nd July, 1715, at the battle of Preston, he headed a
storming party of 12, and advancing to the barricades of the
insurgents, set them on fire, in spite of a furious storm of
musketry, by which 8 of his men were killed.</p>

<p>I abridge from the "Dictionary of National Biography,"
and other sources, the following note of Colonel Gardiner's
last fight:&mdash;On 19 April, 1743, Gardiner became Colonel
of the 13th Hussars, then quartered in East Lothian, in which
district Gardiner had lately purchased a residence. On the
outbreak, in 1745, Gardiner's and Hamilton's Dragoons were
retained in the low country, while Cope set out to oppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Pretender in the highlands. 14 August, 1745, four troops
of Gardiner's Dragoons marched to Perth, but had to retreat,
chiefly owing to the supineness of Cope and the fame of the
Pretender's highlanders. On 20 September, 1745, the two armies
sighted each other at Prestonpans, and the battle was fought the
following morning. "Gardiner's Dragoons were posted on
Cope's right wing, and after the discomforture of Whitney's
Dragoons were ordered to charge the enemy, but after a faint fire
only 11 obeyed the word of command, the others wheeling
round and galloping from the field. The battle was irretrievably
lost; but Gardiner, who had already been wounded by shots in
the left breast and right thigh, seeing a party of infantry who
were bravely fighting near him without an officer to head them,
rode up to them crying out, 'Fire on, my lads, and fear nothing!'
but at that moment he was cut down by three more wounds&mdash;one
in his shoulder by a ball, another in his fore-arm by a broadsword,
and the third was a blow on the head from a Lochaber
axe. He was carried to the manse of Tranent, and lived until
the forenoon of the next day."</p></div>

<p>THOMAS GORDON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Born at Cairness, 8 December, 1788, son of Charles Gordon, of
Buthlau. Was at Eton, 1800 to 1804. Matriculated at Brasenose
College, Oxford, 20 January, 1806. Cornet in the Greys 10
December, 1807. Lieutenant in March, 1809, and before the
close of the year exchanged into the 43rd Regiment. In 1810
he quitted the British service and started on foreign travel. In
1813 he served as Captain on the Staff of the Russian army. In
1816 he was at Constantinople and married Barbara Kana, afterwards
Baroness de Pedaiges, a lady of Armenian Greek extraction.
In 1821 the war of Greek independence began, and he served
as <i lang="fr">chef d'&eacute;tat</i> major under Ipsilanti. He took an active part at
the siege of Tripoliza, and after the town was taken he remonstrated
against the treacherous massacre by the Greeks of several
thousand Turks. His representations being disregarded, he quitted
the service. At last, after many urgent requests that he would
join the Greek service again, he, in May, 1826, returned to
promote unity and military discipline. In January, 1827, he
accepted the command of the expedition to the Pir&aelig;us with the
local rank of Brigadier. His aim was to relieve Athens, then
blockaded by Kutahi. Gordon successfully landed his troops at
Port Phalerus "under the nose of Reshid Pasha." On 11 February
the Turks made a determined attack, but were driven back with
great slaughter. Finding that Athens was still able to hold out,
he wished to resign, but was induced to continue upon condition
of receiving supplies and being "entirely master of his own
operations." He continued until the arrival of General Church
to take over supreme command as generalissimo. On April 16
Gordon was appointed Director-General of the Ordnance Department.
On May 6 the disastrous battle before Athens put
an end to all organised military operations by the Greeks in
the Morea. The battle of Navarino soon ended the struggle.
In 1832 was published in London his "History of the Greek
Revolution," a work of great value. On the formation of the
Greek Kingdom he was appointed Colonel <i lang="fr">&agrave; la suite</i> and Colonel
on the Staff of the Greek army. On 7 July, 1835, he was
appointed Major-General. He died at Cairness, 20 April, 1841.</p></div>

out to the number of about 4,300 men, besides the sick and wounded, which
could not yet be transported for want of conveniency. We have put 5 battalions
into the place under the command of Major-General Welderen; and while the
neighbourhood of the French army obliges us to continue here to level our
works and repair the breaches at Menin, we have ordered some cannon, with a
detachment, to attack Dendermonde. The troops will be all before the place
to-morrow or Saturday. My brother Churchill is appointed to command the
siege, and if the dry weather hold, I hope we shall in a few days be masters of
the town, which will secure the Pays de Waes and a good part of Brabant.</p>

<p>SIR THOMAS LIVINGSTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Born in Holland, 1652, was elder of the two sons of Sir Thomas
Livingstone, who was created a baronet by Charles I., and was
colonel of a regiment of foot in the Dutch service. His mother
was the daughter of Colonel Edmond, of Stirling. He succeeded
his father as second baronet of Newbiggin, and acquired military
reputation as an officer in the Scots Brigade in the pay of
Holland. He came to England with William of Orange in
1688 as colonel of a regiment of foot, and on 31 Dec., 1688, was
appointed colonel of the royal regiment of Scots Dragoons, now
the Royal Scots Greys. Livingston served in Scotland under
General Hugh Mackay, and when in command at Inverness, by
forced marches with a body of horse and dragoons, surprised and
completely routed the Jacobite forces under General Thomas
Buchan at Cromdale, on 1 May, 1690. The engagement put an
end to the resistance of the clans. Livingston succeeded General
Mackay as commander-in-chief in Scotland, and was sworn of the
Privy Council. On 1 Jan., 1696, he became Major-General on
the English establishment, and on 4 Dec., 1696, was created
Viscount of Teviot in the peerage of Scotland, by patent to him
and his heirs male.</p>

<p>Livingstone married Macktellina Walrave de Nimmeguen, from
whom he appears to have separated. She "pursued" him in the
Scottish courts in November, 1703, for the sum of 500<em>l.</em>, to pay
her debts contracted since he left her, and alimony at the rate of
400<em>l.</em> a year. The lords of session "recommended, under the
circumstances of the case, to cause pay her bygon debts, and to
settle somewhat upon the lady yearly with the time coming, and
to treat with the Viscount to that effect" (see Launder, Sir John,
Lord Fountainhall, Decisions, ii., 200). As a result probably of
this litigation, Teviot sold the colonelcy of the Scots Greys on
7 April, 1704, to Lord John Hay. In the Great Seal Registers
are charters of resignation by him of the lands of Lethington, on
23 June, 1702, and of the lands of Waughton on 26 July, 1704.
Teviot became a lieutenant-general on 1 Jan., 1704. He died in
London, aged 60, on 14 Jan., 1711, when having no heirs male,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the viscountcy became extinct, and the family baronetcy devolved
on his brother, Sir Alexander Livingstone, third baronet. Teviot
was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his brother is said to
have erected to his memory a sumptuous monument which no
longer exists. By his will, dated 27 Sept., 1710, he left his house
and estate, known as Livingston House, Wimbledon, Surrey, with
furniture, plate, etc., to Lady Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of
Charles Gordon, second earl of Aboyne. The lady, at this time
a child, died unmarried in 1770. The remainder of his property
went to his brother, Sir Alexander, except a legacy of 1,000<em>l.</em>
to his cousin-german, John Cornelius Edmond, then residing in
Holland.</p></div>

<p>MURRAY, LORD CHARLES, FIRST EARL OF DUNMORE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Second son of John, second Earl and First Marquis of Atholl, by
Lady Amelia Sophia Stanley, daughter of the seventh Earl of
Derby, was born in 1660. On the enrolment in 1681 of General
Thomas Dalyell's regiment of horse, now the Scots Greys, Lord
Charles Murray was appointed its first lieutenant-colonel. He
was also master of horse to Princess Anne. After the death of
Dalyell he, on 6 Nov., 1685, obtained the colonelcy of the
regiment, and was also about the same time appointed master of
the horse to Mary of Modena, queen consort of James II. During
1684 he was engaged in the campaign in Flanders, and was
present at the siege of Luxemburg.</p>

<p>On 6 Aug., 1686, he was created by James II. Earl of Dunmore,
Viscount Fincastle, and Lord Murray of Clair, Moulie, and
Tillemot; at the Revolution he was deprived of all his offices.</p>

<p>After the accession of Queen Anne, Dunmore was sworn a privy

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The "Dictionary of National Biography" is the authority for the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Belonged to the Steuarts of Kincardine. Was born at Knock
in 1700. Served for some time as a Lieutenant and Quartermaster
in the Scots Greys; but being refused a commission in
the Black Watch, he resigned. Then he was employed as a
Jacobite agent, and being arrested, he broke out of Inverness
Gaol, by the connivance of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat. He
fought in the French Army at Fontenoy, 30 April, 1745. Then
he joined Prince Charles at Blair Atholl, and was put in command
of the Edinburgh regiment, and fought at Prestonpans and
Culloden. Afterwards a price was placed on his head, but in
spite of many hairbreadth escapes, he was never betrayed.
Gaelic songs and laments composed by him, are to this day well
known in the Highlands."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>25 November, 1681, commission to be Major.</p>

<p>Born in 1615. M.A. of Glasgow University, 1631. In 1632
enlisted in the service of Gustavus Adolphus under Sir James
Lumsden, and saw much active service, until on the breaking out
of the Civil War, he became Major in the Earl of Kirkcudbright's
regiment of Covenanters; but he never took the Covenant. In
1647 he was made Adjutant-General of the Scots Army. In 1651,
as Colonel and Adjutant-General of Foot, he accompanied Charles
the Second to the Battle of Worcester. He was taken prisoner
and sent up to London; but escaped on the way at Oxford. He
then walked to London, where he lay hid for a time, and afterwards
joined Charles at Paris. At the Restoration he was
knighted. He received a commission as Major, 12 February,
1663, and in July was employed as one of the Visitors of Glasgow
University. On 28 July, 1666, he was made Lieutenant-Colonel.
He was in charge of the forces in the south-west of Scotland,
whose object was to crush the opposition of the Covenanters to
Charles the Second. On 15 November, 1666, at Dumfries, he
was surprised by the Covenanters and taken prisoner. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
engagement on the Pentland Hills, 28 November, his guards
fled, and he escaped. On 10 March, 1668, he was deprived of
his command, on charges of acting with too great rigour.</p></div>

<p>1777. Worcester, May 10th. Major-Gen. Parker.&mdash;"The regiment is very fit for service, and
though the men are not particularly upright, makes a handsome appearance, the men are to be
supplied with <em>bearskin caps</em> at their next clothing, and the officers are to be provided likewise
with bearskin caps, it was said in excuse for the badness of the horses tails, that on account of
the colour their tails were frequently plucked, and the hairs stolen. The officers mess together
and seem to live in harmony. The trumpeters when the regiment dismounted and formed in
battalion, played two of them on clarionettes, two French horns and two on bassoons, and there
is besides a music master paid to instruct them, who was present in the field."</p></div>

chain in the horse shoe case,&mdash;in watering order the men wear Russia duck trousers, and make

into the sale-room again, would have fetched a far higher price when it was first cast could his contemporaries
have had guarantee of the falseness of the prophecy which it expresses. Those were the
days when the Volunteer movement was born; those the days when Pitt promised an importunate
squad that they should not be sent out of the country&mdash;except in case of actual invasion. At about
this time a notable prayer was published. It begins by invoking a blessing upon 'a' in this house,

The Scots Greys lying in Hamilton Barracks are commended to favour. 'They are braw

<p class="center">THE WATERLOO BALL
</p>

<p>The Congress of Vienna was about to break up, not in the best possible humour, when the
announcement fell like a thunderbolt that Napoleon had escaped from Elba, which had been assigned
to him on his abdication in 1814, that he had landed in France, had entered Paris, and had
re-ascended the throne. The Allied Sovereigns soon silenced their differences in a harmonious
resolution to combine against the disturber of the peace. Napoleon was declared the common
enemy of Europe, his sovereignty was ignored, and preparations for war at once entered upon. It
is estimated that by June a million of men were ready to fall upon France.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington established his headquarters at Brussels, where he had with him in
and about the city over 25,000 men. The city was filled with fashionable non-combatants of all
nations, including numbers of British who had long been cut off from the Continent, and had been
drawn thither by curiosity, or from having relations in the army. The whole place teemed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
intrigue, for there were still a large number of officials who had served under Napoleon, and were
ready to return to him. However, everything outwardly remained quiet, and there was no sense of
immediate danger. Parties were common, "and all went merry as a marriage bell." Among the
social entertainments none was so much talked about as the now historic ball which was given by
Charlotte, Duchess of Richmond, wife of Charles, fourth Duke of Richmond and Lennox, K.G.,
who, with their family, had occupied a villa in Brussels since the Duke relinquished the Lord-Lieutenancy
of Ireland in 1813. The Duchess was a daughter, by his beautiful wife, Jean, of the
fourth Duke of Gordon, known by the Highlanders as the "Cock of the North." The daughter
of a soldier, the wife of a soldier, and the mother of one, her Grace was in close touch with the
army. In her youth there were few more attractive girls than Lady Charlotte Gordon when she
used to appear in the feather bonnet and Gordon tartan plaid, in compliment to the 92nd Highlanders
and Gordon Fencibles, which her father had raised.</p>

<p>The much-talked-of ball took place on the 15th June, 1815, ninety years ago yesterday. At
three o'clock in the afternoon of that day a messenger arrived with important news for the Duke of
Wellington that Napoleon at the head of his army had crossed the Sambre that morning, and had
forced the Prussians to retire through Charleroi and Fleurus to a position near Ligny. The Duke
immediately sent off orders for his troops to hold themselves in readiness to move, but not to
advance. The latter he delayed until the evening, when reports from Mons had satisfied him that
the attack was not a feint, and that Napoleon really had taken the Charleroi road. The critical
state of affairs did not prevent the Iron Duke from attending the ball. On the contrary, he not
only went himself, but he encouraged his officers to attend, thinking that their presence there would
have a reassuring effect on the people of Brussels. In the room, the coachmaker's store improvised
for the occasion, were assembled some two hundred guests, including ladies well known in English
society, and most of the Duke of Wellington's staff&mdash;the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Brunswick,
Lord Hill, Sir Thomas Picton, Sir Henry Clinton, the Earl of Uxbridge, Lord Edward Somerset,
Sir Hussey Vivian, Sir William Ponsonby, Sir Denis Pack, and others. The news had spread that
the French army was about to cross the frontier, and it caused a very natural sensation, but the
dancing was not interrupted. Indeed, we are told that it was maintained with unusual spirit, as if
to make the most of the enjoyment which was so soon to be interrupted. An interesting incident
occurred which does not appear to have been recorded. During an interval in the dancing, a party
of non-commissioned officers of the 92nd Highlanders, headed by their pipers, proudly marched into
the room, having been specially invited to give an exhibition of the reel to her Grace's British and
foreign guests; never did these Gay Gordons dance with greater grace, or to a more appreciative
audience.</p>

<p>The imperturbable Duke of Wellington remained at the ball till past midnight, constantly
receiving messages and giving orders privately to the staff. He then quietly withdrew for the
desperate encounter which was destined to be the crowning scene in a military career of unequalled
brilliancy. The other officers gradually left the room and joined their regiments, many in their
dancing pumps. The Duchess of Richmond and her daughters took no further part in the ball; her
husband and two of her sons had accompanied the troops. But the girls generally are said to have
shown great heartlessness. After saying farewell to their partners, many of them for the last time,
they continued dancing for some hours. Meanwhile, drums, bugles, and pipes sounded the
assembly through the silent streets; the soldiers came swarming out like bees, and Brussels was soon
astir at the unwonted bustle. What followed is well known. Two days later Napoleon's pride was
crushed by the most glorious victory ever won by British arms; and, alas, the voice of many a
gallant soldier who, but a few hours before, had been a welcome guest at the historic ball in Brussels,
was silent in the grave.</p>

<p>The identity of the famous ball-room in Brussels has been the subject of much controversy.
For many years it was assumed that the house had been pulled down and the ground built over.
The villa occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Richmond has disappeared in the sense that it has
been absorbed in the Hospital of the Augustinian Sisters; but it was established by the late
Sir William Fraser to his own and the general satisfaction of the public, that the ball was never held
in the villa. It took place in the store-room, hired for the occasion, of Mons. Simon, the coachmaker,
he who built the famous carriage which Napoleon used in the campaign. It was separate
from the villa, and still stands in the Rue de la Blanchisserie, in the lower part of the town, being
part of the building which had returned a few years back to its original purpose of a coachmaker's
factory and dep&ocirc;t. The room is a long barn-like one, with smooth, old-fashioned pillars, and a
polished floor, and has been likened to the Lower School at Eton under Long Chamber&mdash;the same
square, solid pillars, a low ceiling, and brick, whitewashed walls.</p></div>

<p>Major Ker Fox, late 19th Hussars, to Colonel Williams, 14th December, 1905.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In looking through some family papers the other day I came across the enclosed
letter written to an ancestor of mine, nearly 150 years ago, by a trooper in the North British
Dragoons....</p>

<p>"Revd. Sir&mdash;Experiencing your wellwishes for me when presant &amp; Expecting A Continuance
of the same emboldens me to send you word of my welfare being assured that it will be acceptable.
I have long since Designed to do what I am now about, That I might be answered By the good
account that you and all my acquaintances are well. I have the greatest reason to bless God that
I am still Alive For truely Sir since we have been Abroad many have fallen By Death some by the
fatigues of War &amp; number in ye Field, yet to me has the Lord been Sufficient having as yet saved
my health &amp; covered me from all the Dangers Ive been exposed to. I might here tell you of our
transactions During this Campaign but being persuaded you are no stranger to them I will only say
that our Fatigue has been great, For ever since the 20th of last March that our Regiment left winter
quarters we have moved up &amp; down. First from Paderborn to Bergen where we fought the French
&amp; the Battle being as it were Drawn on both sides we could not live there being then no forage on
the ground &amp; what was in the houses the French had it forraged into their Maggazins so that for
want of forrage we were forced to Leave the Frontiers of the enemy &amp; march for Hess Castle where
we abode 3 weeks, till the Forrage appear'd in the Field, the French came down after us with one
Army &amp; Formed another near Lipstadt where we open'd the Campaing. It is strange indeed to
hear the various accounts of the enemy amongst us for the perhaps not 3 miles Distant from others
their Number will by talk Increas or decreas 50000 in a Day, here they were given out for 190000
Men which I beleve Did not amount to more than 100000. Which was by far the supperior
Number for ours was never 80000. So that at the eve of the Battle &amp; for some weeks before All
was Hush non knew aney thing till directly put in Execution. So great was the conduct of our
Brave Prince Ferdinand, Orders for marching on the 1st of August was no sooner given than the
French began to cannonade the Princes Quarters thinking to draw our army there when they would
have flank'd us. But the Prince Left the Place, &amp; March'd us to the Left. That with the Blessing
of God altered the whole for they were briskly Repulsed &amp; By the same means there great numbers
was put to a Wofull Flight. It is true the sight and presence of the Field is terrable, But the Victory
soon Dispell'd it. Altho many suffer'd on Both sides, Here the face of affairs were chang'd And we
are almost so far advanc'd After them as where we fought at Bergen. There is scarce a Day but
we gain some Advantage over them &amp; with Little Loss on our side, so that if God continues his
Favours on our army the enemy will soon Leave Germany. Marbourg surrendered the 1st Days
Seige &amp; Never a Man lost on our side. About 4 days ago we forc'd the out Posts of their flying
Camp &amp; got 800 prisoners. We Rejoiced here yesterday for the Good News from England &amp; Saxony
By fireing all the Cannon &amp; small arms in the Field 3 times. The French Ly about 6 miles from us,
we march foreward the morrow, so that if they dont Abandon their Campment we expect another
engadgement soon. I have here Dear &amp; Revd Sir I am afraid taken to much time in telling you the
thing you have long since been acquaint with; But I hope you will excuse Me in so Doing and
Remember me with my comerades at the Throne of Grace, Being confident of your care, I pray
that God give your endevours the Blessing of Turning Many that Dwell in Darkness to Him, And
that your Reward may be great, is the ernest Prayer Rev. Sir of your Most Obedient Servant&mdash;<span class="smcap">William
Knox</span> Dragoon.</p>

<p>"<em>If you Please Turn oer</em></p>

<p>"I will be obliged greatly if you would Answer this soon Derecting to Wm Knox Dragoon in
the Royl. North British Dragoons Col. Prestons Troop With the Grand Alied Army&mdash;Germany.
And Remember me earnestly to all my Worthy Friends that are your Hearers.</p>

<p>"<em>N.B.</em>&mdash;I had this By me since the 17th and has had no opertune of sending it away before this
Date. We are now just by the French and its Beleved that we wont seperate Before we engadge
again, we having been close to them these 7 days. A small River only parts us. The French head
quarters is at Geeshen and ours at Stroffsdorf. Their Campment is strong and ours is the same.
We saddle every Night &amp; doe not unsadle till we see the enemy's Camp when the fog is off in the
morning. Our Piquets and advanc'd Posts Lys by theirs all night &amp; Returns to Camp when assured
they are still.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel Williams</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>I do not know whether you ever heard of the following, or not&mdash;if not, then perhaps
it may serve its purpose....</p>

<p>During a big day at Aldershot, "the Greys," one of the cavalry regiments engaged, was missed
from the scene of action in the Long Valley. A.D.C.'s, gallopers, and mounted orderlies were sent
all over the place to find them.</p>

<p>The commanding officer had simply dismounted his men, and got them into the "Cocked Hat"
wood, and told them they might get their pipes out and take it easy. When at length found, an
A.D.C. rode up to the colonel, and said that the general had missed the regiment, and was extremely
put about in consequence, and told the commanding officer that he (the general) wished the regiment
to retire behind the crest of some rising ground.</p>

<p>It is reported that the commanding officer at that time, not being very good at handling his
regiment, thought he saw his way out of the difficulty, and with great dignity said, "Young man,
go back to your general, and tell him that the Greys <em>never</em> retire." ...</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Williams</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>We were on the Curragh ... and next us were the old Gordons. We were always
pointing out to them that, for Scotchmen in the ranks, they could not hold a candle to us. One
day some of them came to us, and told us they had a batch of recruits coming, real Highlanders, such
as we had not, "none of 'em had seen the English," and the band and pipes had gone to Newbridge
to "march 'em up." So down we all went to the outlet of the Newbridge road to see the arrival on
the Curragh. Sure enough, soon we heard the pipes and saw the sporrans swinging, always a glorious
sight! and on the boys came, straight from their mountains and glens. But, alas! as they passed us
and came in full view of the Curragh, a young recruit in the ranks turned to his comrade and said,
"Why, bust me, Billy, if this ain't Putney 'Eath without the pubs." Tableau! and triumphal march
home of the old Greys.</p>

<p>At the same period as this, one night the old Gordons poured through windows and doors into
our mess and fairly wrecked us. So we joined forces and went for the 9th Lancers together in the
same fashion. When all was smashed, all lights out, and everybody was leaning up against walls in
torn and tattered mess uniform trying to get breath, in came a frightened mess waiter with a candle
stuck in a ginger-beer bottle. This revealed a tablecloth on the floor still heaving up and down,
the last struggle of a glorious fight. This was slipped away, and underneath was found the
Junior Sub. of the Gordons tightly gripping the Colonel of the 9th Lancers by the throat&mdash;the
chief nearly black in the face. But a more good-natured man never lived. He made it a subject of
chaff, and a bond between all three regiments was thereby forged which I know will never be
broken....</p>

<p>At Dundalk in 1868 during a good run with the Regimental Drag Hounds, a grey horse,
Barabbas, owned and ridden by Lieutenant Bashford, pounded the field over a very boggy brook. At
dinner the same evening, while discussing the extraordinary cleverness of the horse (after clearing
the brook a native having roared out "Begorra, he changed on a trout"!), Mr. Wilkinson, the
resident magistrate of Castle Bellingham, made a bet of &pound;25 that Barabbas could not jump the
mess-room table. The bet was at once accepted, and Mr. Bashford getting permission of the
Colonel, went straight off to the stable, put on the saddle and bridle, and brought the horse into the
mess-room. Captain Hicks, the paymaster, jumped on his back, and in a second had cleared the
table.</p>

<p><em>Scene</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Crimea</span>, two or three days before the charge of Balaclava. The Scots Greys are
mounted and drawn up in line behind a hill waiting for orders. Lieut.-Colonel Darby Griffiths is
sitting on his horse in front of the centre of the line. To him comes a young and very excited staff
officer at full gallop, who says: "Colonel, ten men who dare go anywhere and know no fear are
wanted at once. They must be desperate fellows, as they have a desperate job to perform. Please
let me have them as soon as possible." Old Darby Griffiths, scarcely turning in his saddle, and
without a moment's hesitation: "Greys, from your right number off ten!"</p>

<p class="center">THE LOST DUCKS
</p>

<p>Some years ago a famous and historic cavalry regiment was moving from England to Ireland, marching
by detachments, mostly of a troop each, to embark at Liverpool. These were billeted at nights in
some town, foot and horse billets often widely scattered, and sometimes far separated one from the
other. In the mornings, at the time appointed for marching away, all assembled at the rendezvous,
usually the market-place, or a main street near the hotel where the officers were quartered. There a
dense crowd watched the parade, the inspection, and the march off. On a certain occasion, the
captain of C Troop, just before turning out, was interviewed by an angry, excited inn-keeper, who
declared that the troopers billeted on him had stolen two of his fine, fat, white ducks. The captain
assured him he must be mistaken, but that every means would be taken, if it were so, to detect and
punish the culprits, and promised compensation. Owing to the great crowd round the parade,
nothing could be done until clear of the town. On these marches, when horses were liable to sore
backs and rubs from careless saddling, packing kit, girthing, etc., it was usual, after a trot, to halt a
mile or so away from the billets, dismount, and carefully examine each horse and its equipment. On
this occasion, the captain ordered kits to be unpacked, cloaks to be unrolled sufficiently to prevent the
possibility of ducks being concealed in them. He then rode round the ranks drawn up on both sides
of the road, and made a careful inspection. It revealed not even a feather of the ducks. From the
next town he wrote to the aggrieved complainant, proving him to have been mistaken, and saying
that such a charge should not have been brought against his men, who were incapable of stealing.</p>

<p>It was some years before the truth became known to the captain. In those days, officers on the
line of march sent their light baggage by train with their servants, and carried nothing on their horses
except brushes and stable rubbers for smartening up before entering a town, but they were ordered to
carry behind the saddle a long-shaped valise, supposed to hold the kit, but usually filled with hay or
straw to prevent rubbing the horse's back.</p>

<p>On that day the missing ducks were packed away in the captain's valise, and during his inspection
and the whole of the day's march, he carried behind him the theft he was seeking to discover.</p>

<p>Extract from letter by the Honourable Charles Hamilton to his brother,

to Lord Binning, who allowed his cousin, Captain Lindsay, to have this extract
carefully made for him by the Honourable Hen. Dalrymple, brother of the
Earl of Stair.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Buna Camp, Aug. 28th, 1760.</em></p>

<p>The Army stays where it was at Warburg. The Duke changed his quarters to Bunay a few days
ago, it is about eight miles from Warburg. We are to march this day. The French marched from
ground some time ago towards Cassel. The Hereditary Prince attacked their rearguard,
the Grays &amp; Inniskillings attacked some Cavalry, they were the only British Cavalry with the Prince,
&amp; tore them like pork &amp; made dogs of them. In the persuit they were saluted with a fire from some
infantry that killed several &amp; wounded a good many. Col. Preston had his horse killed upon a bridge
both he and his horse fell over, he was a good deal bruised.</p></div>


<h3>NOTES ON CREICHTOUN'S MEMOIRS</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Kindly supplied by J. B. Dalzell, Esq.</em>)
</p>

<p>Creichtoun says:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>He</em> commanded at Ayrsmoss. (Bruce of Earlshall did.) "The Royalists
killed about sixty and took fourteen prisoners." (Nine only were killed and five
taken prisoners.)</p>

<p>2. The "rebels" at Drumclog were "eight or nine thousand strong."
(There were only 250 in all.)</p>

<p>3. Sir Robert Hamilton, who commanded at Drumclog was "a profligate
who had spent all his patrimony." (The evidence of the historian, Bishop
Barnet, and of other reputable authorities, is all the other way.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The number of the "rebels" at Bothwell Bridge was 14,000, and the
bridge was "guarded with three thousand of the rebels." (Three thousand
is nearer the mark, with only two or three hundred guarding the bridge.)</p>

<p>5. The "rebels had set up a very large gallows in the middle of their
camp, and prepared a cartful of new ropes at the foot of it in order to hang the
king's soldiers." (This gallows was simply the usual permanent gallows of the
Sheriff Court of Lanarkshire Netherward.)</p>

<p>6. David Steele was dispatched by swords <em>in his absence</em>. (Steele surrendered
under promise of quarter and a fair trial. But Creichtoun conveyed him to
Steele's house, nearly a mile, and there in the presence of the man's wife and
her little babe, Mary Steele, ordered the dragoons to shoot him. To their
credit, the dragoons absolutely refused and rode off, but the Highlanders, who
probably knew Gaelic only, and were therefore ignorant of Creichtoun's gross
breach of faith, fired.)</p>

<p>These six instances are but a sample of the exaggeration and mendacious
inventions only too common throughout Creichtoun's memoirs, and the reader
would therefore do well to hesitate before accepting what is not corroborated by
independent evidence.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE ON GENERAL DALYELL
</p>

<p>Immediately after the death of General Dalyell, his eldest son Thomas was
created a baronet of Nova Scotia. Considerably over one hundred varieties in
spelling this curious ancient Scottish surname have been collected. The General
and his father, the Sheriff of Linlithgowshire, uniformly spelt their surname
Dalyell, as their descendants are in the habit of doing at the present day.</p>
