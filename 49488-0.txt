PREFACE.


In bidding farewell to this book before publication, I am most anxious
to thank with hearty sincerity all those who, as past or present
officers and friends of this historic regiment, have helped my
efforts. There are two names above all that I must most particularly
record--(i.) that of Colonel Coventry Williams, lately commanding
the Greys, who has helped in so many details, though I can only
particularly refer readers to pages 291, 292 and 293. Colonel Williams
is the half-brother of Captain Williams, a portrait of whom, as he
stands by his charger, I have been able to include in this volume, and
who, as named by Kinglake (quoted on page 78), brought the Greys out
of action at Balaclava. There, too, Kinglake refers to the anonymous
officer whose Crimean recollections are given on pages 80 to 84. That
officer has since died, and so, too, has Russell, the famous _Times_
correspondent, with whom he was exchanging affectionate greetings.
(ii.) In the next place I must record my gratitude to Major Lindsay,
who has shown the keen instinct native to the noble house of Crawford.
His grandfather opened his famous record with this quotation from
"Schir David Lyndesay of the Mont allias lyoun herauld king of Armes":--

    "Who that antique stories reads
    Consider may the famous deeds
    Of our nobil progenitours;
    Which should to us be right mirrours,
    Their virtuous deedis to ensue,
    And vicious living to eschew."

The fact is that to hold the King's commission in the Royal Scots Greys
inspires a host of chivalrous thoughts and memories. Picture the simple
pride shown in the laconic words quoted on page 293, "Greys, from your
right number off ten!" and see pages 52 to 74. Here are letters from
Francis Charlton Kinchant, who received his commission on 18th January,
1815, and was killed at Waterloo. After writing to a friend accounts
describing how zealously he was learning to practise the art of war,
he goes on: "The regiment is without doubt the best and the most crack
cavalry corps in the service. I don't think there is a private in it
under 5 feet 11 inches." The next personal allusion, describing the
uniform of the corps, is to his own father: "Our dress altogether is
extremely rich and consequently costs lots of money. The Court dress
coat alone is 40 guineas. It is covered with lace from head to foot.
The jackets are handsome, but they cost Â£15. 15. each. Every other
part of the equipment is equally as expensive. In fact we make a most
dashing appearance. I should like much to meet the old Buck at Bath or
Clifton. I do not think he would know his hopeful son."

It is interesting to identify the noble Colonel James Gardiner, killed
at Preston Pans, as an officer in the Greys. Of course the regiment has
always held a peculiarly interesting position. For instance, it does
not join the ordinary rota for foreign service. It shares with a very
few the privilege of having a special honorary Colonel-in-chief.

Before writing of Sir Thomas Dalyell, the first colonel of the
regiment, I wish to thank most cordially Mrs. Cornwall Dalyell of
The Binns, who most kindly allowed photographs to be taken of the
manuscripts of (and relics pertaining to) Sir Thomas Dalyell himself.

Thomas Dalyell or Dalzell, of Binns, was born about 1599, and seems
to have taken part in the Rochelle expedition in 1628, as captain in
the Earl of Morton's regiment. In 1640 he was serving under Major
Robert Monro at Aberdeen. He accompanied Monro in his expedition to
Ireland, 8th April, 1642, having obtained a commission as colonel to
command 2,500 men. On 6th May, 1651, he was appointed by the King as
General-Major of Foot, and fought at Worcester on 3rd September. He
was taken prisoner and committed to the Tower, but escaped to the
Continent. In March, 1654, he appeared off the northern coasts of
Scotland, and helped in the rebellion in the Highlands in that year.
Although a reward and free pardon were offered to anyone who would
give him up, dead or alive, he again escaped to the Continent, and
received from Charles a special letter of thanks, dated Cologne, 30th
December, 1654. On 19th July, 1666, he was appointed Commander-in-chief
in Scotland. Captain Crichton wrote of him: "He was bred up very hardy
from his youth; he never wore a peruke, nor did he shave his beard
since the murder of King Charles the First. He died on Sunday evening,
23rd August, 1685."

                                                                   E. A.

                          HISTORICAL RECORDS
                                OF THE
                          ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.




CHAPTER I.


In writing this record of the history of the Royal Scots Greys I have
aimed at giving scenes and characters as exactly as possible. I have,
therefore, used contemporary language without any modern editing. The
book will contain particulars relating to every officer who has ever
held a commission in the Regiment.

Before describing the origin of this famous Regiment, it will be well
to refer briefly to the title Dragoon. It will be noticed that in
the early official warrants, Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, are always
three distinct forces. The Dragoon was nearly allied to the Mounted
Infantryman, who, in modern times, has evoked such great public
interest. A captain was usually described as appointed to command, not
a troop, but a company.

On the breaking out of the war with Holland in 1672 a regiment of
Dragoons was raised; the pay was at a lower rate than the Horse, and
the men were armed as Infantry, except that a limited number carried
halberds instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets, and a
few in each troop had pistols.

The warrant, dated 2nd April, 1672, requires that the new force--

  "shall be armed out of our stoares remaining within Our office of
  the Ordinance as followeth; that is to say, three corporalls, two
  serjeants, the gentlemen at armes, and twelve souldiers of each
  of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and carry each of them
  one halbard, and one case of pistolls with holsters; and the rest
  of the souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are to have
  and to carry each of them one matchlocke musquet, with a collar
  of bandaliers, and also to have and to carry one bayonet or great
  knife. That each lieutenant have and carry one partizan, and that
  two drums be delivered out for each Troope of the said Regiment."

By warrants dated 21st May, 1678, two independent troops of Dragoons
were raised, their respective Captains being John Strachan and John
Inglis.

This was the beginning of the Royal Scots Greys.

On 23rd September, 1678, Viscount Kingstoun was commissioned to be
Captain of "a new company of Dragoons appointed by us to be forthwith
levyed."

Four days later, Francis Stuart, of Coldingham, was appointed
Lieutenant of this new company.

On July 24th, 1679, Francis Stuart became Captain of this new company
in succession to Viscount Kingstoun who resigned.

By Royal Warrant on the 25th of November, 1681, three troops were
ordered to be added to the three already raised, and the whole six
formed into a regiment. See page 13.

The following extract relates to the state of Scotland and proposed
increase of forces there. (State Papers--Scotland--Warrant Books, vol.
iv., folio 370):--

"CHARLES R.

  "Right trusty and welbeloued Cousins and Councellors.--Wee greet
  you well. After full and satisfactory information from the
  Lords commissionated by you here, of what has been done by you
  in our Service, Wee doe againe approve of your proceeding, and
  thank you for your care, assuring you of our favour, assistance,
  and protection, upon all occasions; and for the more effectual
  prosecution thereof, wee find it necessary to signify to you,
  and by you to our people there, that wee are firmly resolved to
  owne and assert our authority, so as may equally encourage you
  and discourage all such as by seditious Practices endeavour in
  aspersing you to lessen our Prerogative: And finding by good
  information that the Phanaticks there, expecting encouragement from
  such as oppose you, and taking advantage of the present juncture of
  affaires here, have of late with great insolence flocked together
  frequently and openly in ffield conventicles those Rendevouses of
  Rebellion, and haue dared to oppose our fforces, though wee neither
  heed nor doe fear such insolent attempts, yet from a just care of
  our own authority, and a kindnesse to our good subjects there, we
  haue thought fit to order that some more fforces may be trained;
  and for that effect wee haue commanded the Lords of our Treasury to
  take an effectuall course for providing what money wee shall find
  necessary for raising and maintaining those Troopes at our charge,
  And wee expect from you an exact and speedy Account of what number
  and quality of Troopes may be necessary there upon this occasion;
  to the end wee may direct commissions, and give such other orders
  as wee shall find requisite. For doing whereof this shall be your
  Warrant, and so wee bid you heartily ffarewell.

  "Given at our Court at Whitehall the 7th day of May 1678, and of
  our Reigne the 30th."

[Illustration: +Charles the Second's Commission dated 19th July, 1666+,

Lieut.-Generall Drumond is Colonell."]

Directed on the back thus:--

  "To our right trusty and welbeloved Cousins and Councellors ... our
  Privy Councell of our ancient Kingdome of Scotland."

The very next warrant makes John Strachan Captain of one of "ye two
companies of Dragoons to be forthwith leavied." It was followed under
the same date by others, one making John Inglis Captain of the other
company, one making John Lauder Lieutenant of Strachan's company, and
another making William Cleland Lieutenant of Inglis's company. Then
followed still two more, one appointing John Livingston Ensign in
Strachan's and the other, Henry Dundas, Ensign under Inglis.

"CHARLES R.

  "Charles the Second by yáµ grace of God king of Scotland, england,
  france and Ireland Defender of yáµ faith &c. to our trusty and
  welbeloved John Strachan greeting: Wee reposing speciall trust and
  confidence in your Loyalty, Courage and good Conduct, doe by these
  presents constitute and appoint you to be Captaine of one of yáµ two
  Companies of Dragoones appointed by us to be forthwith leavied for
  our service in our ancient Kingdome of Scotland, which Company is
  to consist of one hundred men besides officers. You are therefore
  carefully to discharge the Duty of a Captaine by exercising yáµ said
  Company in Armes, both Officers and soldiers, and keeping them in
  good order and Discipline. And wee doe hereby command them to obey
  you as their Captaine, and you likewise exactly to observe and
  follow all such Orders and Directions as you shall from time to
  time receive from Us, our Privy Councell, the Commander in chiefe
  of our fforces in that our Kingdome now or for the time being,
  or any other your superiour officer, according to the Rules and
  Discipline of Warre, in pursuance of yáµ trust which wee doe hereby
  repose in you.

  "Given at our Court at Whitehall the 21th day of May 1678--and of
  our Reigne the 30th year."

The following order relates in part to the _three Independent Troopes
of Dragoones_. (War Office Miscellany Orders, vol. v., folio 179):--

  "Whereas his Majesty hath thought fitt to order the immediate
  Raiseing of three Regiments of Horse consisting of eight Troopes
  each Regiment, and sixty men in each Troope besides Officers: as
  also three Regiments of Foot consisting of four Companyes each
  Regiment, and one hundred men in each Company, besides officers;
  and one Regiment of Dragoons consisting of eight Troopes, and
  eighty men in each troope, besides officers, _and three other
  Independent Troopes of Dragoons_, of the like number; and three
  Troopes of Horse Granadiers, consisting of eighty men in one of the
  Troopes, and sixty men in each of the other two Troopes, besides
  officers.

  "You are to pass and allow the said Regiments, Troopes and
  Companies, according to the directions following.

  "The first muster of any of the troopes of Horse is to be from the
  officers first produceing twenty or more good men well mounted to
  be mustered, and the following musters shall be upon produceing
  five men with their Horses till the whole Troope be compleated. The
  officers are to be allowed and enter into Pay from their said first
  muster of Twenty.

  "The foot are to be mustered as any of them are raised, and the
  officers of each Company are to be allowed from the time they
  muster twenty.

  "The first muster of every Troope of Dragoones, is to be upon the
  officers produceing twenty-five good men suitably mounted, and the
  officers then are to be allowed, and the following musters shall
  be of eight men with their Horses till the troope be compleated.
  The first Muster of the Horse Granadiers is to be upon produceing
  thirty men well mounted and the officers then to be allowed, and
  the following Musters to be in the same manner as those of the
  Dragoons. The field officers of each Regiment are to be allowed
  from the first muster of their respective Companies, and you are to
  pay the staff officers from the time appointed for the Regiment to
  Rendezvous.

  "Given at the Court at Whitehall this 11th day of June 1679.

"+Monmouth.+

  "To Henry Howard, Esqre., Commissary General of the Musters."

The next is of varied interest, giving the Duke of Monmouth supreme
command, and urging to be kept informed by "flying packets." (Vol. v.,
page 156.)

"Whitehall, 11th June, 1679, at Midnight.

  "May it please your Lordship I am commanded by his Majesty to
  acquaint you that in pursuance of his Resolution to send some
  Supplyes from hence to you for suppressing the Rebellion now
  amongst the Phanaticks in the West of Scotland, he hath ordered
  a Regiment of ffoote to be presently embarqued to goe by Sea to
  Barwick together with cannon and ammunition sufficient, and his
  Majesty has ordered two Regiments of ffoote more to be presently
  leauied, the one to be commanded by the Lord Cavendish and the
  other by the Lord Gray of Wark, as also three Regiments of Horse
  under the command of the Duke of Monmouth, Duke of Albemarle,
  the Lord Gerard, Together with eight hundred Dragoons, There is
  likewise three troopes of Granadiers, and these last are to march
  towards Scotland to-morrow. The King has also thought fit to name
  the Duke of Monmouth Generall to command all his fforces so long as
  his Grace shall remaine in Scotland. His Majesty by this Expedition
  will be at the charge of upwards of five hundred pounds sterline
  a day, which is more than Â£150,000 sterline by year if they
  continue so long. And seeing the King has so early provided for
  the preservation of his royall government and your common safety,
  he has just reason to expect that in the meantime you will bestow
  your utmost care and diligence as far as possible to suppresse that
  vile Rebellion. His Majesty presseth much that frequent flying
  packets may be sent at least every other day that he may know all
  things that pass, and that they may bear large and exact accounts.
  All which by his Majesty's command is signified to your Lordship
  by my Lord, your Lordships most humble and most faithfull servant,
  +Lauderdale+.

  "To the Right HonáµË¡áµÂ· The Earl of Rothes, Lord high Chancellor of
  Scotland. To be communicated to the remnant Lords and other of his
  Majesty's most honourable Privy Councell of that Kingdome."

The next relates to the rebellion, and to the appointment of "Thomas
Dalzell to be Lieutenant General of all His Majesty's forces in that
his ancient kingdome." (Vol. v., folio 167.)

"Whitehall, 19áµÊ° June, 1679.

  "May it please your Lordships. It was yesterday in the evening
  that your Letter of yáµ 15áµÊ° instant (by a flying Packett) came
  to my hand, and I did immediately waite on the King with it, who
  after his reading it was pleased to declare that he was very well
  satisfied with your recommending Generall Thomas Dalzell to be
  Lieutenant Generall of all his Majesty's Forces in that his ancient
  Kingdome, and gave me a command for Preparing his Commission for
  that purpose; wherein I would lose no time, for it was ready this
  morning for his Royall hand, and he was graciously pleased to
  signe it, as you have it now hereinclosed. His Majesty is also
  exceedingly well pleased with the march of his fforces last Munday
  against the Rebells, and with the extraordinary care and diligence
  that have appeared in all your consultations and actions since the
  first notice you had of the breaking out of this Rebellion, which
  he hopes (by the blessing of God, and the continuance of your
  faithfull endeavours) will be soone crushed. It was likewise a
  great satisfaction to his Majesty to know that you were resolved
  to send fflying Packetts frequently for he has a very earnest
  desire to be informed as often as possible, of the transactions
  there, during the continuance of this Rebellion. Your Lordships may
  be pleased to send this Letter to the Duke of Buccleugh, and this
  commission to the Lieutenant Generall with all speed.

                            "I am My Lords, ...
                                                    "+Lauderdale+.
  "To Earl Rothes...."


Folio 168 contains the Commission.

All the foregoing are from documents in the Record Office.

The next extracts are picked from the British Museum copy of a rare
autobiography, "The Memoirs of Captain John Crichton, written by
Himself." Printed in the year 1731. The peculiar interest of the words
that follow is that they were written wholly as the experiences of one
of the first officers of the Greys.

Whereupon Mr. Francis Stuart, grandson to the Earl of Bothwell, a
private gentleman in the Horse-Guards, like myself, and my intimate
acquaintance, was sent for, in haste, by the General; because the
Council of Scotland was then writing to the King that his Majesty would
be pleased to grant commissions to those persons whose names were to be
sent up to London that very night. Mr. Stuart gave me notice of this:
whereupon, although I was not sent for, I resolved to go up with him to
Edenborough, and solicit for myself.

The General: "Wha' the Deel sent for you up?" I answered that I hoped
his Excellency would now make good his promise of preferring me ... the
General stood my firm friend, and although the sons and brothers of
Lords and Baronets and other persons of quality solicited to be made
Lieutenants and Cornets, in these new raised Troops, yet the General
in regard to my services, prevailed with the Council that I might
be appointed Lieutenant to Mr. Stuart, who was then made Captain of
Dragoons.

Soon after this, the Archbishop of St. Andrews was murdered by the
Laird of Hackston and Balfour, assisted by four poor weavers.

[Illustration: +Charles the Second's Commission dated 19th June, 1679.+

Appointing "Generall Thomas Dalzell 'Lieutenant Generall' over all the
Forces within our ancient Kingdome of Scotland."]

The Council finding the Rebels daily increasing in their
numbers ... his Majesty sent down the Duke of Monmouth ... to be
Commander-in-chief.... General Dalziel refused to serve under him,
and remained at his lodgings in Edenborough, till his Grace was
superseded, which happened about a fortnight after.... The General
Officers ... desired his Grace to let them know which way he designed
to take to come at the Enemy, the Duke answered, it must be by Bothwell
Bridge. Now the bridge lay a short mile to the right of the King's
Army, was narrow, and guarded with 3,000 of the Rebels, and strongly
barricaded with great stones; but although the Officers were desirous
to have passed the river, by easy fords, directly between them and
the Rebels and to march to their main body on the moor, before those
3,000, who guarded the bridge, could come to assist them; yet the Duke
was obstinate, and would pass no other way than that of the bridge.
Pursuant to this preposterous and absurd resolution, he commanded
Captain Stuart (whose Lieutenant I was) with his troop of Dragoons,
and 80 Musqueteers, together with four small Field-pieces, under
cover of the Dragoons, to beat off the party at the bridge. The Duke
himself, with David Lesly and Melvill, accompanyed us, and ordered
the Field-pieces to be left at the Village of Bothwell, within a
musquet-shot of the bridge. When the Duke and his men came near the
bridge, the Rebels beat a parly, and sent over a Laird, accompanied
with a Kirk Preacher.... While this Parly lasted, the Field-pieces
were brought down and planted over against the bridge, without being
perceived by the Rebels. The messengers ... they would not lay down
their arms unless their conditions were granted them; whereupon the
Dragoons and Musqueteers fired all at once upon those who guarded the
bridge, and the Field-pieces played so warmly, that some hundreds of
the Rebels were slain; the rest flying to the main body on the moor.
The Duke, as soon as he had commanded to fire, retired into a hollow
from the enemies' shot; ... and continued there till the action was
over. Then Captain Stuart ordered the Musqueteers to make way for the
Horse, to pass the bridge, by casting into the river the stones which
had been placed there to obstruct the passage over it; but the army
could not pass in less than five hours; and then marched up in order of
battle towards the enemy, who waited for them on the moor, confiding in
the superiority of their numbers. Clavers commanded the Horse on the
right, and Captain Stuart the Dragoons on the left. The Field-pieces
were carried in the centre of the Footguards, while the rest of the
Officers commanded at the head of their men; and the Duke, after the
enemy was beaten from the bridge, rode at the head of the Army. Upon
the first fire, the Rebel Horse turned about.... Sir John Bell, Provost
of Glasgow as soon as he saw the Rebels fly, rode into the town; from
whence, in a few hours, he sent all the bread he could find, together
with an hogshead of drink to each troop and company in the Army, out of
the cellars of such townsmen as were found to be abettors or protectors
of the Rebels.

The Pursuers were no sooner returned, and the whole action over, than
General Dalziel arrived at the camp from Edenborough, with a commission

[Illustration: +Charles the Second's Commission dated 11th November,
1681.+

Appointing "Lieutenant Generall Thomas Dalzell 'Colonell' of a Regiment
of Dragoones to be formed out of the three Companies of Dragoones
already standing in that our Kingdome, and three Companies more to be
added to them."]

On Saturday morning when the army was to march to Glasgow, I desired
the General's leave to go with twelve Dragoons in search of some of
the Rebels, who might probably pass the Clyde, about Dunlatton, to
shelter themselves in the Highlands. With these Dragoons, clad in grey
coats and bonnets, I made haste down the side of the river; and about
midnight, after travelling twenty-four miles, I came to a church, and
while the soldiers stayed to refresh their horses in the churchyard,
I spyed a country fellow going by, and asked him in his own dialect,
"Whither gang ye this time of night?" He answered, "Wha are ye that
speers?" I replied, "We are your ane Foke." Upon this the fellow came
up and told me; there were 18 friends with horses at an old Castle
waiting for a boat to pass over into the Isle of Arran. I mounted the
man behind one of my Dragoons, and went towards the place; but the
Rebels not finding a boat were gone off, and the guide dismissed. There
was a great dew on the grass, which directed me and my party to follow
the track of their horses for three or four miles, till the dew was
gone off; I then enquired of a cowherd on a hill whether he saw any of
our poor Foke travelling that way; he answered that they had separated
on that hill and gone three several ways, six in a party, adding, that
in one party there was a bra muckle kerl, with a white hat on him,
and a great bob of ribbons on the cock o't. Whereupon I sent 4 of my
Dragoons after one party, 4 more after another, and myself with the
remaining 4 went in pursuit of him with the white hat.... The good man
of the house returning from putting the horses to grass in the garden
was going to shut the door, whereupon myself and one of the Dragoons
commanded him, with our pistols at his breast, to lead us to the room
where the man lay who wore a white hat. We entered the room, and before
he awaked I took away his arms, and commanded him to dress immediately;
then finding his companion asleep in the barn, I forced him likewise to
arise, and mounting them both on their own horses, came at 9 o'clock in
the morning with my two prisoners to the other Dragoons at the place
where we appointed to meet. From thence we rode strait to Glasgow,
and arrived thither about 8 in the evening, after a journey of 50
miles since we left the Army at Bothwell the day before. The man with
a white hat had turned out to be Master John King.... About a month
after I happened to dream that I found one Wilson, a Captain among the
Rebels at Bothwell Bridge, in a bank of Wood upon the river Clyde. This
accident made so strong an impression upon my mind that as soon as I
awaked I took six-and-thirty Dragoons, and got to the place by break
of day. Then I caused some of them to alight and go into the wood and
set him up, as hounds do a hare, while the rest were ordered to stand
sentry to prevent his escape. It seems I dreamt fortunately, for Wilson
was actually in the wood with 5 more of his company, as we afterwards
learned, who all seeing me and my party advancing, hid themselves in a
little island on the river among the broom that grew upon it. Wilson
had not the good fortune to escape.... I seized and brought him to my
quarters, and from thence immediately conveyed him to Edenborough,
where he was hanged; but might have preserved his life if he would have
condescended only to say, God save the King. This he utterly refused
to do, and thereby lost not only his life, but likewise an estate
worth twenty-nine thousand marks Scots. For this service, the Duke of
Queensberry, then High Commissioner of Scotland, recommended me to the
King, who rewarded me with the gift of Wilson's estate; but although
the grant passed the Seals, and the Sheriff put me in possession, yet I
could neither sell it nor let it, nobody daring, for fear of the Rebels
who had escaped at Bothwell Bridge, either to purchase or farm it, by
which means I never got a penny by the grant; and at the Revolution the
land was taken from me, and restored to Wilson's heirs....

"The winter following, General Dalziel, with a battalion of the Earl of
Linlithgow's Guards, the Earl of Airly's troop of Horse, and Captain
Stuart's troop of Dragoons, quartered at Kilmarnock in the west, 50
miles from Edenborough. Here the general one day, happening to look
on while I was exercising the troop of Dragoons, asked me, when I had
done, whether I knew any of my men who was skilful in praying well in
the style and tone of the Covenanters; I immediately thought upon one
James Gibb, who had been born in Ireland, and whom I made a Dragoon.
This man I brought to the General, assuring his Excellency that if I
had raked Hell, I could not find his match for his skill in mimicking
the Covenanters. Whereupon the General gave him Â£5 to buy him a gray
coat and a bonnet, and commanded him to find out the Rebels, but to
be sure to take care of himself among them. The Dragoon went 8 miles
off that very night, and got admittance into the house of a notorious
Rebel, pretending he came from Ireland out of zeal for the cause,
to assist at the fight of Bothwell Bridge, and could not find an
opportunity since of returning to Ireland with safety, he said he durst
not be seen in the day-time, and therefore after bewitching the family
with his gifts of praying, he was conveyed in the dusk of the next
evening, with a guide, to the house of the next adjoining Rebel; and
thus in the same manner, from one to another, till in a month's time
he got through the principal of them in the west, telling the General
at his return, that wherever he came he made the old wives in their
devout fits tear off their biggonets and mutches; he likewise gave the
General a list of their names and places of their abodes; and into the
bargain, brought back a good purse of money in his pocket. The General
desired to know how he had prayed amongst them; he answered that it was
his custom in his prayers to send the King, the Ministers of State,
the Officers of the Army, with all their soldiers, and the Episcopall
Clergy, all broadsides to Hell, but particularly the General himself:
"What," said the General, "did you send me to Hell, Sir?" "_Yea_,"
replied the Dragoon, "you at the head of them, as their leader....

"During the winter and the following spring I secured many of those
whose names and abodes the canting Dragoon had given a list of....
In July following, the General, by order of Council, commanded me to
go with a detachment of 30 Horse and 50 Dragoons in pursuit of about
150 rebels who had escaped at Bothwell Bridge, and ever since kept
together in a body up and down in Galloway. I followed them for 5 or
6 days from one place to another; after which, on 22nd of July, they
stayed for me at Airs Moss.... The Moss is 4 miles long from east to
west and 2 broad. The Rebels drew up at the east end, and consisted
of 30 Horse and 120 Foot. I faced them upon a rising ground with my
30 Horse and 50 Dragoons. The reason why the Rebels chose this place
to fight on rather than a plain field was for fear their Horse might
desert the Foot, as they did on Hamilton Moor, near Bothwell Bridge:
and likewise, that in case they lost the day they might save themselves
by retreating into the Moss. I placed myself on the left, as judging
that the best officer the Rebels had would command on the right. The
action began about 5 in the afternoon, but lasted not long; for I
ordered my men first to receive the enemy's fire, then to ride down the
hill upon them and use their broad-swords. They did so, and before the
enemy had time to draw theirs, cut many of them down in an instant.
Whereupon they wheeled about, and Captain Fowler, who commanded the
Rebels on the right, being then in the rear, advancing up to me, I gave
him such a blow over the head with my broad-sword as would have cleaved
his scul had it not been defended by a steel cap. Fowler turning about,
aimed a blow at me, but I warded it off, and with a back stroke cut the
upper part of his head clean off from the nose upwards. By this time
the Rebells, leaving their horses, fled to the Moss; but the Royalists
pursuing them killed about 60 and took 14 prisoners. Here Cameron,
the famous Covenanter, lost his life, and Haxton was taken prisoner,
infamous for embruing his hands in the blood of the Archbishop of St.
Andrews ... for which paricide both his hands were afterwards cut off,
and he was hanged at Edenborough. But this victory cost me very dear,
for being then in the rear I rode into the Moss after the Rebels where
I overtook a dozen of them hacking and hewing one of my men whose horse
was bogged; his name was Elliot, a stout soldier and one of Claver's
troop. He had received several wounds, and was at the point of being
killed when I came to his relief. I shot one of the rogues dead with my
carbine, which obliged the rest to let the poor man and his horse creep
out of the hole, but at the same time drew all their fury upon myself;
for Elliot made a shift to crawl out of the Moss leading his horse in
his hands, but was wholly disabled from assisting his deliverer, and
was not regarded by his enemies who probably thought he was mortally
wounded, or, indeed, rather that they had no time to mind him; for I
laid about me so fast that they judged it best to keep off and not
to venture within my reach, till it unfortunately happened that my
horse slipped into the same hole out of which Elliot and his horse had
just got. When they had me at this advantage they began to show their
courage and manfully dealt their blows with their broad-swords, from
some of which the carbine that hung down my back defended me a little.
As I was paddling in the hole, the horse not able to get out, one of
the rebels ran me through the small of the back with his broad-sword,
and at the same instant two more wounded me under the ribs with their
small ones. Then I threw myself over the head of my horse, taking
the far pistol out of the holster in my left hand, and holding my
broad-sword in my right; and as one of the villains was coming hastily
up to me his foot slipped, and before he could recover himself I struck
my sword into his skull; but the fellow, being big and heavy, snapped
it asunder as he fell within a span of the hilt. The Rebels had me now
at a great advantage. One of them made a stroak at me which I guarded
off with the hilt of the sword that was left in my hand, but the force
with which he struck the blow--and I kept it off--brought us both to
the ground. However I got up before him, clapped my pistol to his side
and shot him dead. As soon as this was done another came behind me, and
with some weapon or other struck me such a blow on the head as laid me
flat on my back, in which posture I remained a good while insensible,
the rogues taking it for granted that I was dead, scoured off.

"A little recovering my senses, I strove to lift up my head, which one
of the rogues happening to see at some distance, immediately returned,
and said in my hearing: 'God, the dog is no deed yet.' Then coming up
to me, took his sword, and putting its hilt to his breast and guiding
it with both his hands, made a thrust at my belly; but my senses were
now so far recovered that I parried the thrust with the piece of the
sword which remained still in my hand. The fellow, when he missed his
aim, almost fell on his face, for the sword ran up to the hilt in the
moss; and as he was recovering himself I gave him a dab in the mouth
with my broken sword which very much hurt him, but he aiming a second
thrust, which I had likewise the good fortune to put by, and having
as before given him another dab in the mouth, he immediately went off
for fear of the pursuers, whereof many were now returning. In this
distress I made a shift, with much difficulty and pain, to get upon my
feet, but my right leg being disabled by the wound I received from the
broad-sword, I was forced to limp by the help of the carbine, which I
made use of as a staff. I had lost my horse, for one of the rogues,
when I had quitted him in the hole, led him away through the Moss. I
recovered him about a year after from the man to whom the rebel had
sold him."

This next letter, from the King, taken from the Record Office, refers
to the three Independent Troops of Dragoons, and orders three more
Troops to be levied, and the whole six to be then _regimented_, thus
establishing the Royal Scots Greys:--

"CHARLES R.

  "My dear and most entirely beloved Brother. Wee greet you well.
  Wee have thought fit for the good of our Service to retrench all
  the Companyes of ffoote of our Regiment of Guard commanded by the
  Earle of Linlithgow, and likewise all the companies of the Regiment
  of ffoote commanded by the Earle of Mar, as also to retrench every
  one of the three Companies of Dragoons now standing. Therefore
  you are to give order to Generall Thomas Dalyell, our Lieutenant
  Generall, to reduce and disband six men out of every Company of the
  above mentioned two Regiments of ffoote (and this ouer and aboue
  any former Retrenchment made by us as to the ffoote) and forty-five
  Dragoones of every one of the three Companies of Dragoones aboue
  mentioned, together with one Corporall of Dragoones out of every
  one of the said three Companies, and that this Retrenchment
  be made upon the last day of November instant, and that these
  Souldiers ffoote and Dragoones so disbanded receive pay till that
  day inclusive. Wee have likewise thought it necessary for our
  Service that three Companies of Dragoones be presently leavied,
  each Company consisting of fifty souldiers, centinell Standers
  (besides the officers' servants allowed by our Establishment), and
  wee appoint each Company to haue two Sergeants, two Corporalls
  and two Drummers, besides the officers commissioned by us. _Wee

  already standing so reduced with those three to be Leavied shalbe
  Regimented_; and to that affect wee have commissioned our said
  _Lieutenant Generall to be Colonel thereof, Lord Charles Murray to
  be Lieutenant Colonell and Sir James Turner to be Major;_ and that
  each of them have one Company in that Regiment. You are therefore
  to give order to our Lieutenant Generall to cause these Companies
  to be leauied accordingly, and to bring them as soon as can be to
  a Muster; at and after which Muster they are to enter into Pay
  conforme to our establishment. For doing of all which this shalbe
  your Warrant, and so Wee bid you heartily farewell. Given at our

[Illustration: +Warrant of Charles II.+,

Granting "certain revenues to Thomas Dalzell as Lieutenant Generall in
command of the Forces in Scotland."]

John Creichton, of the Massacre of Glencoe, writes:--

  "McDonnal, Laird of Cappagh, in the Highlands, ... was unjustly
  possessed, as most men believed, for many years, of an estate,
  which in right belonged to the Laird of Mackintosh.... Soon after,
  the Government ordered me to detach 60 Dragoons, with a Lieutenant,
  Cornet, and Standard, and to march with Captain Streighton, and
  200 of the Foot Guards against the McDonnels.... Whereupon we, who
  were sent against him, continued to destroy all the houses and
  corn, from the time of Lammas to the 10th of September; and then
  we advanced towards the Borders, to join the Scotch army, at that
  time marching towards England, against the Prince of Orange, then
  intending an invasion."

[Creichton now goes on with his account of the coming of William the
Third, which is, of course, a mistake in order.]

  "We arrived thither October 1st, after a march of 200 miles.... The
  army did not reach London till about 25th October.... The Earl of
  Airly, when he was Lord Ogleby, had attended the great Marquess of
  Montrose in all his Actions, for King Charles the First and Second.
  But at this time being old, it was reported that he was dead,
  before the Scotch Forces went into England, to oppose the Prince of
  Orange; whereupon the King had given his troop in Dundee's Regiment
  to the Earl of Anandale: but the Earl having overtook the Army at
  Cambridge, in their march, went on to London, and there presenting
  himself before the King; his Majesty ... immediately restored his
  Lordship to his Troop, ordering him at the same time to command
  those 200 men who attended him down to Salisbury. When all the
  Forces were arrived at Salisbury, the Earl of Dunmore, with his
  Regiment of Dragoons, wherein I served, was ordered to a Pass 3
  miles below the City, where I commanded the Guard that night.

  "I now return to my Lord Dundee, and my Lord Dunmore. Their
  Lordships acted no longer as Colonels, when they understood that
  the Prince intended to place himself on the throne during his
  Majesty's life.... After their Lordships were gone to Scotland, I
  went to Watford, where my Lord Kilsythe, as Lieutenant Colonel,
  commanded the Lord Dunmore's Regiment of Dragoons.... Major General
  McCoy ordered the Lord Kilsythe to march the Regiment from place
  to place till they should come to Congerton, a town in Cheshire.
  Here they quartered, when the Prince and Princess of Orange were
  proclaimed King and Queen of England, &c., by the Sheriff and
  3 or 4 Bailiffs. It happened to be a very stormy day; and when
  the Sheriff had done his Office, a crack-brained fellow, at the
  head of a great rabble, proclaimed the Duke of Monmouth king, to
  the great diversion of the Regiment; not believing he had been
  beheaded. When my Lord Dunmore refused to serve the Prince of
  Orange, Sir Thomas Levingston, of my Lord Kilsythe's family, got
  the Regiment. This gentleman was born in Holland, and often used to
  raise recruits in Scotland; upon which account he was well known
  to the Regiment. He came down, Post, to Congerton, and at Supper,
  told the officers that he was sent to know, which of them would
  serve King William and which would not? Now the oath of allegiance
  to that Prince, having not been offered to that Regiment, one of
  the Company answered that we having sworn Allegiance to King James,
  could not, in conscience and honour, draw our swords against him:
  Whereupon Sir Thomas, drinking an health to King James, upon his
  knees, answered that he wished he might be damned, whenever he
  should command them to break that oath: and in order to ingratiate
  himself further with the Regiment, added: that he would return to
  London next day, for a command to march them strait to Scotland,
  where their wives and friends were; and likewise to procure a
  Captain's commission for me, since Sir Adam Blair, who commanded
  the troop, in which I was Lieutenant, had refused to serve King
  William, both which he accordingly obtained. When he returned from
  London, he marched with the Regiment, directly through Berwick,
  into Scotland.

  "From this period, my troubles began; for I was then sent up to
  Edenborough, and there imprisoned in the Tolbooth, together with my
  Lord Kilsythe, Captain Levingston, Captain Murray, and Lieutenant
  Murray, each of us in a separate dungeon; with orders that none
  should be permitted to speak with us, except through the keyhole;
  and in this miserable condition we lay for two months.... The
  Council, although they could force no confession from me, or my
  companions, that might affect my Lord Kilsythe, on whose estate
  their hearts were much set, yet resolved to make a sacrifice of
  someone among us ... the lot fell on me.... Lord Dundee, then at
  Blair Castle in Athole, hearing this, wrote to the Council--that if
  they hanged Captain Creichton, he would cut the Laird of Blair, and
  the Laird of Pollock, joint by joint, and would send their limbs in
  hampers to the Council."

Books in my possession. Each volume is bound in boards covered with
fine white vellum, with gold tooling in Mearne's style.

The first opens with the Accession of James the Second; but the first

The next entry is under the 1st of May, 1689, in William the Third's
Establishment for England. On page 78 is recorded Sir Thomas
Levingston's Regiment of Dragoons.

The numbers and pay appear as before, except for these additions:--

  Chaplain                                                     Â£134
  Gunsmith 4_s._, and his servant 1_s._                          91  5

Also for each Troop are added:--

  Two Hoboys each 12_d._, and 2_s._ for horses, Â£73; and 60 privates
  in each troop. $/

  The second volume begins with April, 1692, and on page 11 the
  Dragoons are recorded with the same numbers and pay, as before.

  The Establishment for Land Forces and Garrisons, 1694, opens on
  page 75 with an interesting list of Regiments and their commanding
  Officers:--Under Dragoons one entry is "Lord Tiviot's."

  After the 1694 Establishment comes that for the 26th March, 1699.
  On page 133, Dragoons are recorded. There is no mention of a
  gunsmith. There is one "Hoboy" 2_s._ per diem.

  Then on page 161 we reach the Establishment of Guards and
  Garrisons, 25th April, 1700.

  The Dragoon Regiments, as detailed on page 168, had only 40 private
  soldiers to each troop.

  The 1st of June (1702) Establishment gives the Dragoons 54 private
  soldiers to a company.

  The following relates to the title of the Regiment:--

  William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of Scotland,
  England, France, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, &c., &c.
  Whereas that Regiment of Dragoons to which our trusty and most
  beloved Councillor, Sir Thomas Livingstone, Brigadier-General
  of our Army, is Colonel, hath been formerly designed the Royal
  Regiment of Scots Dragoons, and so, reposing special confidence in
  the said regiment, we do, hereby, appoint and ordain the same to be
  designed our 'Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons,' and we require all
  general officers and others in our army so to design that regiment;
  and to give the full title and honour that is due to our 'Royal
  Regiment of Scots Dragoons.' Given under our royal hand and signet,
  at our Court at Breda the seventh day of May, 1692, and of our
  reign the fourth year.

  "By His Majesty's command,
                        "+J. O. Dalrymple+."


On 31st May, 1694, the Regiment landed at Williamstadt, in North
Brabant, and on June 16th was reviewed by King William before occupying
cantonments near Arschot. No general engagement took place this year:
but the Regiment was twice engaged in skirmishes with the French
cavalry, and in October marched into cantonments in the villages near
Ghent. Coming out of winter quarters in April, 1695, the Regiment
proceeded to Dixmude, in West Flanders, and thence to join the Army
encamped at Arseele, and on 31st May were reviewed by King William
with the rest of the Army. During the progress of the siege of Namur
the Regiment formed part of the Army under the Prince of Vaudemont
which manÅuvred so as to protect the troops employed before the town.
The Regiment was encamped a short time between Genappe and Waterloo;
it afterwards occupied, together with the Regiment of Foot of
Holstein-Ploen, an important post at Masy, and after the surrender of
the citadel of Namur marched into winter quarters in West Flanders.

In May, 1696, they encamped near Bruges and for some months were
stationed behind the canal between Ghent and Bruges, their duty
being to observe the motions of the French Army commanded by Marshal
Villeroy, which was encamped on the opposite side of the canal. In
October they marched into winter quarters in the villages behind
Bruges. In the spring of 1697 negotiations were opened for a general
peace. They were encamped for a short time between Brussels and Aeth,
afterwards between Vilvorde and Burntbridge, on the Brussels canal; and
when the peace of Ryswick was concluded they marched to Bruges. Before
the end of December the Regiment embarked for England and landing
at Harwich early in January, 1698, marched at once to Scotland. The
establishment which, during the war, had been 8 troops and 590 officers
and men was ordered to be reduced to 6 troops and 294 officers and men.

In 1701 the accession of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Spain
caused war to be declared again on May 15th. The two troops were again
added, and early in 1702 the Regiment embarked for Holland.

The Regiment formed part of the guard for the English artillery train
at Breda, with which it joined the allied army under John Churchill,
Earl of Marlborough.

In the autumn of 1702 the Greys were engaged in covering the sieges
of Venloo, Ruremonde and Stevenswaert. The following is taken from
those most interesting records, Marlborough's own correspondence and
despatches:--

  Sutendal, 21st September, 1702. The castle of Venloo was carried by
  storm last Monday, so that they hope to be masters of the town by
  Sunday or Monday. My Lord Cutts commanded at one of the breaches,
  and the English grenadiers had the honour of being the first that
  entered the fort. We are making all preparations we can for the
  attack of Ruremond and Stevenswaert, and I think no other enemy but
  ill weather can hinder us from taking them.

  2 October. Our batteries began to play upon Stevenswaert on
  Saturday last, and continued firing without intermission till
  about 10 last night, when, the besieged having abandoned the
  counterscarp, and our men being ready to mount the breach, they
  beat the chamade, and desired to capitulate.

  9 October. On Saturday at 3 in the morning, his Excellency the
  Earl of Marlborough received an express from Ruremond, that our
  batteries having begun to play upon the town on Friday morning,
  about 6 the same evening the besieged had desired to capitulate.
  The garrison, consisting of near 2000 men, are to march out this
  day, and to be conducted, with two pieces of cannon, to Antwerp. We
  found in the place 30 pieces of cannon....

The Regiment was also present at the taking of Liege, on October 23rd.
Before going into winter quarters one squadron acted as a body-guard
to Marlborough in visiting Venloo and Ruremonde. The Regiment wintered
in Dutch Brabant. Before the end of April, 1703, the Regiment took the
field again and encamped near Hamont, in the province of Limburg, from
whence they marched to Lardner Heath, afterwards to ChÃ¢teau D'Horn,
near Ruremonde, and on May 7th they reached near to Tongres. In the
meanwhile a party of English cavalry, escorting a quantity of specie
for the Army, was attacked and defeated by a detachment of French
troops, who captured the treasure. The Greys were instantly ordered
out, and dashing across the country intercepted and defeated the French
troops and returned with the specie in triumph back to camp.

Next the Regiment was sent towards Bonn, then being besieged. After the
taking of Bonn it joined the main army near Maestricht on May 21st.

The Regiment was engaged in the siege of Limburg, which fell on
September 28th.

When the famous campaign of 1704 opened Lord John Hay, son of the
Marquis of Tweeddale, became, by purchase, Colonel in succession to
Viscount Teviot.

During the operations under Marlborough on the Dutch frontiers a body
of French troops passed the Black Forest and, joining the Bavarians,
gained several advantages over the Austrians, endangering the Imperial
throne.

In April, 1704, the Greys, joined by a remount from Scotland,
marched to Bedburgh on the Lower Rhine, where they were reviewed
by Marlborough, and on May 19th began its march on that important
expedition. To keep the enemy in suspense, the troops proceeded towards
the Moselle, but on the 25th May changed their route, and marched
to Coblentz. Having crossed the Rhine and the Moselle, Marlborough
pushed forward in advance with the cavalry for the Danube, ordering
the infantry to follow. Continuing their march through the States of
Germany, the regiments crossed the Necker in the early part of June,
while the rapidity of their movements and the secrecy of their design
filled all Europe with wonder and anxiety, and the enemy appeared
confused and lost in doubt and conjecture.

The British Regiments joined the forces of the Emperor, commanded by
the Margrave of Baden, when the new line of battle was formed and the
brigade, consisting of the Royal Scots and Royal Irish Dragoons, was
posted on the left of the first line. Marlborough wishing to possess
Donawerth as a place of arms, decided to attack a division commanded by
the Count D'Arco, posted on the lofty heights of Schellenberg, on the
north of the Danube commanding the passage of that river at Donawerth,
and the Greys formed part of the force chosen for this service. After
marching, on July 2nd, through a country intersected with rivulets
and other obstacles the troops came near to Schellenberg. At 6 in the
evening the attack was ordered, and the British infantry going forward
with firm and resolute step assaulted the entrenchments, while the
Greys and other cavalry moved forward in support. In a few moments a
storm of bullets assailed the ranks of the Bavarians, and the thunder
of the British fire echoed in the valley below. The post was valiantly
defended, and a fierce fight had gone on for some time when the Greys
were ordered to dismount, form as infantry, and assault the trenches.
The regiment instantly obeyed, and led by its gallant Colonel, Lord
John Hay, advanced boldly to the attack and mixed fiercely in the
conflict. At this instant the enemy gave way on all sides, and the
cavalry rushing forward sabred many as they fled towards the Danube;
whilst the Count D'Arco, and other officers escaped by crossing the
river.

The post won and the enemy's baggage, artillery, and many standards
captured, the Royal Scots Dragoons remounted. The Regiment lost in
the action Captain Douglas and 7 men killed, two officers, and 17 men
wounded. Donawerth was occupied on the following day.

The next great event to refer to is the Battle of Blenheim, in the
valley of the Danube, fought on August 13th. The following words are
Sir Edward Creasy's:--"Like Hannibal, Marlborough relied principally
on his cavalry for achieving his decisive successes, and it was by his
cavalry that Blenheim, the greatest of his victories, was won. The
battle had lasted till five in the afternoon. Marlborough had now 8,000
horsemen drawn up in two lines, and in the most perfect order for a
general attack on the enemy's line along the space between Blenheim and
Oberglau. The infantry was drawn up in battalions in their rear, so as
to support them if repulsed and to keep in check the large masses of
the French that still occupied the village of Blenheim.

"Tallard now interlaced his squadrons of cavalry with battalions of
infantry, and Marlborough, by a corresponding movement, brought several
regiments of infantry and some pieces of artillery to his front line
at intervals between the bodies of horse. A little after 5 Marlborough
commenced the decisive movement, and the allied cavalry, strengthened
and supported by foot and guns, advanced slowly from the lower ground
near the Nebel up the slope to where the French cavalry, 10,000 strong,
awaited them. On riding over the summit of the acclivity the allies
were received with so hot a fire from the French artillery and small
arms that at first the cavalry recoiled, but without abandoning the
high ground. The guns and the infantry, which they had brought with
them, maintained the contest with spirit and effect. The French fire
seemed to slacken; Marlborough instantly ordered a charge along the
line. The allied cavalry galloped forward at the enemy's squadrons,
and the hearts of the French horsemen failed them. Discharging their
carbines at an idle distance they wheeled round and spurred from the
field, leaving the nine infantry battalions of their comrades to be
ridden down by the torrent of the allied cavalry."

The Greys lost several men and horses wounded but none killed.

Extracts from a journal of the 1704 campaign kept by Mr. Hare, chaplain
to the Duke, and afterwards Bishop of Chichester:--

  "Being thus resolved to attack the enemy, they gave orders that
  the Army should march before break of day, and range itself in
  order of battle upon the plain, between Grenhiern and Orklau. The
  whole army as it was now (Brigadier Baldwyn and several other
  parties not being yet come in) consisted of 66 Battalions and 160
  Squadrons on the right wing, under Prince Eugene, there were the
  seven Danish and eleven Prussian Battalions, which were all the
  Foot his Highness had under his command; he had also 74 Squadrons
  composed of the Imperial and Prussian Troops, with those of Swabia,
  Franconia, Wurtemberg, and other Troops of the Empire.

  "On the left wing against Marshal Tallard were 48 Battalions (viz.)
  14 English, 14 Dutch, 7 Hessian, and 13 of Hanover, Luxembourg,
  Zell, and Swiss; also 86 Squadrons (viz.) 14 English, 22 Danes, and
  18 Dutch, 7 Hessian, and 25 of Lunenbourg, Hanover, and Zell. This
  Army marched directly towards the enemies (which were then about 4
  miles distant) before break of day in the following order.

  "The Imperial Army filed off to the right in 4 columns (viz.) two
  of Infantry and two of Cavalry. The Infantry marched to the right
  of the Cavalry upon a rising ground, close by a wood which came
  down to the River Kessel before mentioned. The two lines of Cavalry
  marched to the left of them; the English and Dutch army filed off
  also in 4 such Columns, having on their right the 2 Columns of
  the Imperial Cavalry, and on their left the villages of Dapsheim,
  Schwening and the Danube. Major General Wilkies and Brigadier Rowe,
  with 9 Battalions that were left in Dapsheim, to maintain that post
  all the last night, now marched to the left of all by themselves,
  next the Danube. The Imperial Artillery followed the Infantry of
  that wing, and the English and Dutch artillery and Pontoons marched
  through the villages of Erlinghoffen, Dapsheim and Schweingen; and
  all the baggage was sent back to Rittingen near Donawert, where it
  was to be drawn up till further orders.

  "His Grace caused the whole Army to halt, and then detached 11
  Battalions out of both lines of the left wing to be joined to the
  9 already detached under Major General Wilkie near the Danube. The
  whole twenty were to be commanded by the Lord Cutts, and under him
  Major General Wilkies and St. Paul, and Brigadier Ferguson, Rowe
  and Hulson. Major General Wood and Brigadier General Ross were
  ordered with 15 squadrons of Dragoons to sustain the Lord Cutts.
  These Battalions and squadrons being joined with the other nine,
  made a ninth column which marched upon the left of all, by itself,
  next the Danube, the Lord Cutts being ordered with this detachment
  to attack the village of Blenheim, which joined to that River.

  "This being done the Army moved forwards, His Grace and Prince
  Eugene advancing before all, with some squadrons of the Grand
  Guard to take a view of the enemy; they discovered their advanced
  parties before 6 in the morning, which parties as our squadrons
  came up retired by degrees into their camp. About 7 our Generals
  stood and took a full view of the enemies' camp upon a rising ground
  over against Overklau, on our side the Rivulet; it continues to run
  in two Branches till within a few paces before it falls into the
  Danube, the meadows between them being soft and marshy. One of the
  Branches had two mills upon it, at both which there was an easy
  passage over the Rivulet.

  "His Grace saw all this very plainly at half-a-mile distance, but
  he was more particularly informed of the nature of this ground by
  Major General Nazemere, of the King of Prussia's troops, who had
  been wounded the year before in the defeat of Count Styrum by the
  Elector of Bavaria and Monsieur Dupon upon the very place. All this
  while, the morning being a little hazy, the enemy might think we
  had only little parties abroad and not know that our whole Army was
  in motion. However it was they lay quiet in their camp, and two
  deserters from them gave his Grace a particular account how their
  troops were encampt.

  "Our Columns began to appear a little after 7 in the morning, both
  officers and soldiers advancing very cheerfully and shewing a firm
  and glad countenance and persuading themselves of a victorious day.

  "All this while the village of Blenheim had been incessantly
  attacked by the Lord Cutts, who having found it impracticable to
  enter that place sword in hand, as the enemy were posted, had
  altered his method and attacked with his fire only. The first
  of his lines (which was posted near the enemy's entrenchments)
  continually discharged in Platoons, and the other lines relieved
  this and each other successively.

  "Notwithstanding all which it held out still, and now gave work
  to all our Infantry. For the moment that our Cavalry had beaten
  that of the enemy and cleared the field of them, General Churchill
  marched both the lines of Foot and laid them upon this village
  in two different places, so that it was now quite surrounded and
  there was no getting out of it but through the Danube, and to
  prevent their escaping that way the Queen's Regiment (commanded
  by Brigadier Webb) took possession of a little Barrier the enemy
  had made to cover their retreat and was posted to the right of
  all fronting to the street which led down to the Danube. By this
  means several hundreds of the enemy endeavouring to get of that way
  were made Prisoners by that Regiment which besides this service,
  has the consideration due to it, that the Horses belonging to the
  dismounted Regiments of French Dragoons were at their Piquets close
  by this Regiment, yet there was not a man stirred out of his rank
  to take one of them but they all fell a booty to other soldiers.
  Prince George's Regiment (commanded by Colonel Byton) was posted
  next the Danube to the left, on the other side of the Town; so
  that all those of the enemy which came out that way were either
  taken prisoners, killed, or forced into the Danube; some of them
  endeavoured to break out in two other places of the village, _but
  Major-General Wood (who was left with only the Lord John Hayes's
  Regiment of Grey Dragoons)_ perceiving it immediately advanced
  towards them, and taking the advantage of a rising ground, amused
  them, and made them believe he had more squadrons behind him and so
  drew up and stopped them there.

  "Brigadier Ross (who was ordered to sustain Lieutenant-General
  Ingoldsby) did the like on the other side of the Town with
  5 squadrons of Dragoons and 3 squadrons of Horse which
  Lieutenant-General Lumley had sent from the pursuit for this
  purpose; two of which he soon after sent back again, upon order
  he had received from the Duke of Marlborough to bring all the
  squadrons he could to the right, where the Elector was marching off.

  "It was now betwixt 3 and 4 o'clock when General Churchill sent
  word to the Lord Cutts that the Duke of Marlborough had beaten
  the enemies Horse out of the field. He also let him know that he
  himself was going to attack the same village in Flank and Rear, and
  therefore desired his Lordship to make another attack at the same
  time in the front, if his troops were not too much spent, or at
  least to make a feint of doing it. This was effectually executed
  at once on all sides. The Earl of Orkney and Lieutenant-General
  Ingoldsby entered the village at two different places at the Head
  of their respective Lines, but not being able to make a front equal
  to what the enemy had in the village, especially in the Churchyard
  which had high walls round about it, they were forced to retire.
  However this, and the frequent attacks the enemy had sustained in
  their front for several hours together; the damage they suffered
  by our Cannon which played all the afternoon furiously upon them
  within musket shot, the great disorder they were put into by a
  Battery of Howitzers, whose shells set all the Barns and Houses
  on fire, and especially Monsieur Clerambaut their commander
  being fled and as they were told, drowned in the Danube, and
  being quite surrounded, and obliged to stand another attack at
  a time when they had no hopes of relief, the Cavalry which was
  to sustain them, being drove quite out of the Field: all these
  together put them into so great consternation, that they demanded
  a cessation, which being allowed, General Churchill sent orders
  to the Lord Cutts to cease attacking in the Front, and the Lord
  Orkney immediately sent in Captain Abercromby his Aid du Camp on
  one side as Lieutenant-General Ingoldsby did Lieutenant-Colonel
  Belville of the Tell regiment of de Beial on the other side. After
  a very little time their Lieutenant-Colonel returned with Monsieur
  Hautefeuille and Monsieur Blansac, and the Lieutenant-Colonel's
  own Brother, who was Captain in Nasseys Regiment of Dragoons, then
  dismounted in the Town. The Lord Orkney had also met with the
  Marquis Desnouville, who commanded the French regiment Royal and
  was already made prisoner, but was suffered to go into the Town
  again, upon his parole to return immediately. This he did bringing
  with him to the Lord Orkney several French generals. And as they
  were all capitulating, General Churchill came up and told the
  French Generals that he had no time to lose, (it being now past
  7 in the evening), and that if they did not lay down their arms
  immediately he would renew the attack, upon this they thought fit
  to submit, and they, with all their regiments, were made Prisoners
  at discretion."




CHAPTER II.


The campaign of 1704 closed with the Siege of Landau, the Greys forming
part of the army covering the siege. In September, when the King of the
Romans visited the British camp, the Duke of Marlborough placed himself
at the head of the "Royal Scots Dragoons" to receive his Majesty.

The interesting incident is thus entered by Hare in his Journal:

  "On 2nd of October the King of the Romans came from before Landau,
  to take a view of the Army commanded by his Grace at Weissembourg.
  His Grace sent Colonel Cadogan to conduct His Majesty to the left
  of the Army which was drawn out in two lines for this purpose. His
  Grace there received and saluted His Majesty at the head of Lord
  John Hayes' regiment of Dragoons, and afterwards accompanied His
  Majesty along the lines, which appeared extremely fine and gave
  great satisfaction to his Majesty."

In November they marched back to Holland for the winter, and in
Guelderland were joined by another remount from Scotland.

They were withdrawn from their cantonments early in May of 1705, and
after traversing Limburg, encamped near the banks of the river Maese,
where the Duke of Marlborough assembled the army for the purpose of
proceeding up the Moselle. After a halt of two days, the cavalry
crossed the Maese, and marched to Coblenz, and thence to Juliers. After
leaving this, they crossed a barren country to Triersweiler, where
the troops encamped on May 26th. Thence the Moselle and the Saar were
crossed, and plans made for offensive warfare. This was all frustrated
by Austrian delays and German commanders' jealousies. The Duke of
Marlborough resolved therefore to return.

At midnight on June 17th the troops decamped in the midst of a heavy
rain, and the Royal Scots Dragoons, with several other regiments,
formed up to cover the retreat through a long and narrow defile. No
enemy, however, appeared to interrupt the army, and retracing their
former steps by forced marches, the Greys reached the vicinity of
Maestricht on June 30th; when the French forces in the Netherlands
instantly ceased acting on the offensive, and took refuge behind their
lines.

[Illustration: "+Signatures of Colonel Agnew's Troop, for receipt of
Bountie monie, for Campaigne of 1704.+"]

After several changes of position, the Greys and other corps were
ordered to be ready to march immediately after dark on the evening
of July 17th; and the regiment was formed on this occasion as usual
in brigade with the Royal Irish Dragoons under the command of
Brigadier-General Lord John Hay. The French lines to be taken were very
formidable, for besides the height of the rampart, and the largeness of
the ditch, they were further defended by the difficulties of the ground
over which they were to be approached; and by the river Geet, which
could not be crossed without laying bridges over it, and which was near
enough to the lines to be defended by the fire from the parapet. Our
troops continued their march throughout the night, which was extremely
dark, and at four in the morning surprised the French guards and
took the position. Scarcely had the Greys and Irish Dragoons, with a
few squadrons of horse, passed the lines, when the Marquis d'Allegre
appeared with twenty battalions of infantry and fifty squadrons of
cavalry. The Duke of Marlborough led his horse and dragoons forward,
and by an impetuous charge, broke the enemy's ranks. A short but fiery
conflict followed with varied success, and the Greys displayed their
usual spirit. Finally the enemy's squadrons were dispersed, their
standards and kettledrums were captured, and many officers and men were
taken prisoners. The enemy's infantry also suffered severely; a few
battalions however retired in a square in admirable order.

The campaign closed, and the Scots Greys marched to Dutch Brabant,
where they spent the winter.

From the archives of the Regiment:--

  "Early in 1705 the sheriff (_i.e._, Sir James Agnew) parted with
  his eldest son (Andrew), who at seventeen joined the army in
  Flanders as a volunteer. Pleased at the idea of the boy's winning
  his own spurs, he supplied him with a moderately well-filled purse,
  while his mother, along with her blessing, furnished him with an
  introduction to the Duke of Marlborough, as well as other letters
  of introduction. Thus furnished, the youth embarked, and reached
  the camp in February in safety, where he attached himself to the
  'Royal Grey Dragoons.' At the mess of this distinguished corps he
  met many friends from Galloway. His brother-in-law, Colonel Agnew,
  was Major, whose brother Thomas was also a Captain in the regiment;
  and among the subs. were the young Laird of Mochrun, George Dunbar,
  as well as John Dunbar, his youngest brother. Within a few weeks
  of his arrival he received, to his no small gratification, a
  commission signed by the Duke of Marlborough in camp at Rastad on
  the 11th of May, 1705, appointing Andrew Agnew to be cornet of that
  troop in Her Majesty's Royal Regiment of Scotts Dragoons, commanded
  by the Right Honourable John Hay, whereof Major Andrew Agnew is
  Captain."

Then come three pages of the adventures of the Greys in the campaign in
which the said Andrew took his part. He was afterwards the famous Sir
Andrew who fought in the Rebellion of 1745, and specially noted for his
defence of Blair Castle at that time.

  "Lord Mahon's History of England, Vol. I., chapter 5, page 155,
  edition Murray, 1853.

"1715.

  "Meanwhile the Duke of Argyle had arrived in Scotland about the
  middle of September, and hastened to the camp at Stirling. He had
  brought with him not a single battalion of troops, not one piece of
  artillery. He had found under his command no more than 1,000 foot,
  and a body of Dragoons, partly from that excellent regiment the
  Scots Greys, but altogether of only 500 men."

Sir Walter Scott, in his note on Sinclair's MS., page 304, wrote:--

  "The Dragoons called the Scots Greys, for many years maintained a
  character greatly superior to that of an ordinary regiment. They
  never gave a bounty exceeding a crown, and were recruited from
  a class of persons greatly superior to those who usually enter
  the army, such as the sons of decent farmers and tradesmen, who
  felt a vocation for the army. No ignominious punishment was ever
  inflicted, and a criminal who had merited such was previously
  transferred to another regiment."

Early in May, 1706, they left their winter quarters, and after crossing
the plains of Limburg and the rich valleys of Liege, they on May
20th joined the army encamped at Bilsen, and afterwards marched to
Borchloen. On May 23rd a detachment of the Greys, and several squadrons
of horse, were ordered to march towards Mont St. AndrÃ©, and were soon
after followed by the army in eight columns. There was a thick fog,
but the cavalry pushed on until they gained the heights near Mierdorp,
when through the misty dawn they espied a few of the enemy's cavalry
crossing the plains of St. AndrÃ©, and soon the fog lifting, the French
army was discovered in position at Ramillies. Advancing into the plains
of TandrinÅuil, the Allies prepared for action, the Queen's Horse, the
Greys, and the Royal Irish Dragoons, with Churchill's and Mordaunt's
regiments of infantry, being posted on the heights of Foulz on the
right of the line. About 1Â·30 in the afternoon the Allies began heavy
artillery fire, which was quickly answered by the enemy, and the action
became general. For some time the troops on the heights on the right
were only spectators, but Marlborough, seeing that an attack made by
the Dutch and Danish cavalry on the French Household regiments, Gens
D'Armes, Gardes du Corps, and others, was not succeeding, ordered his
right wing to advance. Churchill's and Mordaunt's regiments descended
first, and meeting three battalions of French infantry, drove them into
a morass, where most of them were killed or captured. At the same time
the Queen's Horse, the Greys, and the Irish Dragoons galloped through
the morass, crossed the high ground beyond it, and attacking the
enemy's left, routed the French cavalry, and cut several battalions of
infantry to pieces. The Greys charged into the village of Autreglize,
overthrew and sabred the infantry in the streets. Coming out of the
village, they encountered the famous French regiment du Roi, which
at once surrendered and delivered up its colours and arms to the
victorious Dragoons.

The contemporary account in the "London Gazette" was as follows:

  "The horse of their left wing seemed to make a stand to gain time
  for their foot to retire, but were charged so quickly and with so
  much bravery by the English, that they entirely abandoned the foot,
  and our Dragoons pushing into the village of Autreglize, made a
  terrible slaughter. The French King's Own regiment of foot called
  the regiment du Roi, begged for quarter, and delivered up their
  arms and colours to Lord John Hay's Dragoons (the Greys)."

In connection with the battle of Ramillies, some account must be given
of a woman, Christian Davies, or Mother Ross, who served as a trooper
in the Greys until, fighting at Ramillies, her skull was fractured, and
her sex afterwards discovered.

In 1740 appeared a book of nearly 200 pages, purporting to record her
life and adventures; also in 1893 she was included in a volume called
"Women Adventurers," published by T. Fisher Unwin. The account of her
given in the D. N. B. seems excellent. Presumably she was brave, but
she seems to have been a very coarse woman. Born in Dublin in 1667,
she married Richard Welsh. He, without her knowledge, was in some way
forced to enlist in a foot regiment, and wrote letters to his wife
which never reached her. At last she heard of his being in the army,
and so disguised herself as a soldier to go in search of him.

She enlisted in Captain Tichborne's company of foot as Christopher
Welch. In a skirmish before the battle of Landen she was wounded, and
in the next year--1694--taken prisoner by the French, but exchanged.

At her own wish she was now allowed to join the Greys, and continued
so until after the peace of Ryswick. On the renewal of war in 1701
she went back to Holland and re-enlisted in the Greys. She fought at
Niuwegen, Venloo, Bonn, and in most of the engagements of the campaign,
till at the battle of Donauwerth she received a ball in the hip,
which caused a temporary retirement into hospital. The ball was never
extracted, but Christian was again under arms in time to share in the
spoil after Blenheim. While forming one of a guard to some prisoners
taken in that battle, she again saw her husband after a separation of
thirteen years. She lost no time in revealing her identity to him; but
so enamoured was she of camp life that she extracted a promise from
Welsh that he would pass himself off as her brother. After Ramillies
she, of course, had to cease to be a trooper, but she still continued
to live in camp, and accompanied her husband as his acknowledged wife.
In 1709 Richard Welsh was killed at Malplaquet. Christian herself found
his body, and her lamentations were so extravagant as to excite the
open commiseration of a Captain Ross, whence it is said she gained the
sobriquet of Mother Ross, by which she was known for the rest of her
days. Although grieving so that for a whole week she refused to touch
food, she married Hugh Jones, a grenadier, within three months. In 1710
Jones was killed at the siege of Saint-Venant. In 1712 she returned to
England, was presented to Queen Anne, and awarded a life pension of a
shilling a day. She afterwards went to Dublin and married a soldier
named Davies. She died on July 7th, 1739, and, at her own request, her
body was interred among the pensioners in Chelsea burying ground, and
three grand volleys were fired over her grave.

After this great victory at Ramillies, on Whit Sunday, May 23rd, 1705,
the Greys were occupied in covering the successful sieges of several
fortified towns in Flanders, and in the autumn the British troops went
into quarters in Flanders, excepting the Royal Scots Greys and Irish
Dragoons, who proceeded to Holland.

Early in the spring of 1707 the Greys went to Spanish Brabant, and
encamped near the banks of the little river Sienne. In this year the
Acts of Parliament were passed for the Union of the crowns of England
and Scotland, and from that time the Greys were designated "The Royal
Regiment of North British Dragoons."

The army was assembled at Brussels, and afterwards encamped near
Weldert. The year passed off very quietly; but Richard Cannon found
some record of a sharp fight between twenty-five troopers of the Greys
sent out to cut forage and thirty French musketeers, the result alleged
being fourteen Frenchmen killed and the rest taken.

On July 11th, 1708, the Greys were engaged in the important battle of
Oudenarde, and this battle, with the story of the events preceding it,
is full of interest, but would be out of place in this record of one
particular regiment.

After this the Regiment formed part of the covering army, and was
employed in escorting provisions and ammunition to the troops laying
siege to Lisle, the capital of French Flanders. After Lisle had fallen
to the Allies, the Greys were sent into winter quarters in Flanders.
The winter proved extremely severe, and a considerable number of men
and horses are said to have been frozen to death.

In 1709 the Greys formed part of the troops covering the siege and fall
of Tournay; but the event of the year was the battle of Malplaquet,
fought on September 11th, 1709. The Greys were brigaded with the Royal
Irish Dragoons, under Brigadier-General Sybourg. They were posted near
the centre of the Allied Army to sustain the attacks of the infantry
and protect the artillery, and for some time were only spectators
of the fierce storm of battle which raged on all sides; at length,
however, they were ordered to file through a wood in their front, and
charge. Scarcely had the brigade emerged from among the trees before it
encountered a line of French cavalry; these squadrons were, however,
soon dispersed, but they were instantly succeeded by a new line of
champions, consisting of a number of squadrons of the French household
cavalry, clad in armour, and advancing in firm array. Richard Cannon
has described how the Greys and Irish Dragoons met these foaming
squadrons with signal bravery, but were driven from their ground by
superior numbers. The two regiments soon rallied, and being joined
by several corps of horse, returned to the charge; yet such was the
resolution displayed by the French troopers that it was not until the
third charge that they were driven from the field. The two victorious
regiments were specially thanked by the Duke of Marlborough. The Greys
lost about thirty killed and wounded.

The regiment was afterwards employed in covering the siege of Mons,
the capital of Hainault, and after the surrender of Mons marched into
winter quarters at the little town of Tiel.

Malplaquet was a desperately hard-fought battle. Not for the first or
last time in our history, an important battle was nearly lost through
the imbecile action of the authorities at home in failing to support an
able general abroad.

In Coxe's "Marlborough," large paper edition, Vol. III., page 90, we
find the following:--

  "In considering the consequences of this eventful day, we cannot
  but applaud the foresight of Marlborough, who before the opening of
  the campaign had so earnestly pressed for a powerful augmentation
  of troops. He was conscious that the French were prepared to make
  their final effort in the Netherlands, and that he should have to
  contend with a far greater force than he had yet encountered. The
  battle proved that his calculations were well founded, and that an
  additional number of 10,000 men on that eventful day would have
  more contributed to the advancement of peace, than all the efforts
  of the ablest negotiators in Europe. The Allies, indeed, remained
  masters of the field; but the laurels of their two great commanders
  were deeply tinged with blood, and the result of the campaign was
  far from being commensurate with the sacrifice of so many valuable
  lives."

Of the springing valour displayed by the enemy on the day of
Malplaquet there can be no question, and a distinguished French officer
wrote to a correspondent at the time:--

  "The Eugenes and Marlboroughs ought to be well satisfied with us
  during that day; since till then they had not met with resistance
  worthy of them. They may say, with justice, that nothing can stand
  before them; and, indeed, what shall be able to stem the rapid
  course of these two heroes, if an army of 100,000 of the best
  troops, posted between two woods trebly entrenched, and performing
  their duty as well as any brave men could do, were not able to stop
  them for one day? Will you not then own with me, that they surpass
  all the heroes of former ages?"

Early in 1710 the regiment was joined by a remount of 100 men and
horses from Scotland, and marching from its cantonments, encamped on
high ground near Tournay. In the afternoon of April 20th it was again
on the march, and formed part of the First Division of the Allied
Army which forced the enemy's fortified lines at Pont-Ã -Vendin on
the 21st, and encamped at night on the plain of Lens; and afterwards
helping in covering the siege of Douay, a strong town on the river
Scarpe, and finally was stationed at Pont-Ã -Nache. While here, the Duke
of Marlborough, by special commission from Queen Anne, invested its
Colonel--the Earl of Stair--with the Order of the Thistle.

On May 10th the enemy made a sudden sally from Fort Scarpe to take
the bread waggons going to the Allies; but reaching Pont-Ã -Nache,
their career was suddenly stopped by a squadron of the Greys, and two
squadrons of the Royal Irish Dragoons, who came sweeping up the plain
at full gallop, and routing the enemy in an instant, chased them with
heavy loss under the cannon of the fort. Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell,
of the Royal Irish Dragoons, who commanded the three squadrons, was
wounded in the pursuit.

After the fall of Douay, the Greys crossed the country of Artois to the
banks of the river Bietres; and encamped before Bethune, which was at
once besieged. They were subsequently occupied in escorting military
stores up the country, and after the taking of Bethune, they were
occupied with the sieges of Aire and Saint-Venant. The surrender of
Aire ended the campaign.

Early in May, 1711, the army assembled in French Flanders, and
encamped, first at Warde, and next on the plain of Lens. After
manÅuvring skilfully, Marlborough succeeded in forcing the enemy's
lines by the causeway at Arleux, crossed the Scheldt, and besieged
Bouchain. In all this the Greys took part. After the fall of Bouchain,
the army retired into winter quarters.

In 1712 the French sued for peace, and the Greys marched from the
frontiers of Picardy into Flanders, staying there until the signing of
the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. They then returned to England at the
close of eleven years of hard war service.

A satisfactory change now took place in the official status of the
Greys. In 1694, when many English, Irish, and Scots regiments were
serving in the Netherlands, King William commanded a board of general
officers to assemble and decide upon the rank of the several corps.
This board gave precedence to the English regiments, and the Scots
and Irish were only allowed to take rank in the English army from the
date of their first arrival in England, or from the date when they
were first placed on the English establishment. There being three
regiments of English Dragoons raised previous to 1688, when the Royal
Scots Dragoons were first placed upon the English establishment, this
regiment consequently obtained rank as Fourth Dragoons only.

But in 1713, when Queen Anne had ordered another board of general
officers to assemble to decide upon the rank of several newly-raised
regiments, proof was adduced that the Royal Scots Dragoon crossed the
Border and entered England in June, 1685, when there was only one
regiment of Dragoons on the English establishment.

This was taken into consideration, and after some delay the Scots Greys
obtained the rank of Second Dragoons.

Regiments were not, however, distinguished by numerical titles before
the reign of George the Second.

In 1713 the regiment was increased to nine troops.

The Greys were next occupied in quelling the Rebellion of the Old
Pretender, and here they won special distinction.

In 1719 the Jacobites, aided by Spain, made another attempt on
Scotland, but were routed on June 10th at Strachell. Three troops of
the Greys under Major Robinson were engaged.

The Farm Buildings used as Barracks by the Scots Greys under command of
John Earl of Stair. The Terraces at Lochinch were constructed by him
during the period the Greys were quartered there, and it is recorded
that the men of the regiment did the work.]

In April, 1721, reduced on account of peace to 207 men, the regiment
left Scotland, and was placed in cantonments in the northern counties
of England. In 1723 it returned to Scotland, and in 1725 marched into
quarters in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

Early in 1727 the Regiment was again increased to nine troops, and it
was ordered to be ready for foreign service, but no embarkation took
place. The nine troops were marched into quarters near Hounslow, and
on October 28th were reviewed on the heath by King George the Second.
They afterwards marched into quarters in Yorkshire, where the three
augmentation troops were reduced, and the numbers of the establishment
of the Regiment fixed at 309 officers and men.

In 1730 the Regiment was again in Scotland.

In 1737 it came back to England, and was chiefly busy on the Kentish
coast suppressing smugglers.

In April, 1738, the regiment marched into Dorset and Wilts, to suppress
popular riots.

In September, 1739, the Regiment was increased to 435 officers and men.
Richard Cannon pictures the regiment spending the following summer
encamped among the ancient oaks in Windsor Forest. In October it
marched into Yorkshire, but soon came south again and was quartered in
Berkshire.

Charles the Sixth, Emperor of Germany, died in 1740, and England was a
party to the Pragmatic Sanction by which the crown was guaranteed to
his daughter Maria Theresa as Queen of Hungary and Bohemia.

On the other hand, the Elector of Bavaria, as descendant of Ferdinand
the First, claimed these countries, and was supported by the French
King, Louis the Fourteenth.

On June 19th, 1742, the Greys were reviewed by King George the Second
on Kew Green, and three days later marched for Dover. A publication
called "The Champion" records:--

  "On Tuesday, General Campbell's fine regiment of Scots Greys
  arrived in the Borough of Southwark on their march to Dover, where
  they are to embark for Flanders. They are fine hardy fellows, and
  want no seasoning, and made an appearance agreeable to all but the
  innkeepers."

For the two great campaigns that now followed I copy from the archives
preserved by the Regiment a

         "+Note from the British Military Library or Journal,
                           published 1799.+

       *       *       *       *       *

  "This regiment frequently distinguished itself in the wars of King
  William and Queen Anne, and in many actions by its own individual
  prowess might justly be said to have inclined the balance in favour
  of the British arms, nor was it less active in the Rebellion of
  1715.

  "In the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, the cool, intrepid and
  invincible courage of this corps was eminently conspicuous.

  "In the battle of Dettingen, the French were commanded by the
  celebrated Marshal de Noailles, and the Allied Army by his late
  Majesty King George the Second and the great Duke of Cumberland.
  The French had nearly effected the utter ruin of the Allies, by
  surrounding them, in order to cut off all supplies, in which case
  the whole must have been reduced to the disagreeable necessity of
  surrendering at the mercy of the enemy, nor could anything short
  of the most unexampled heroism rescue them from the impending
  danger--that heroism was not wanting. The combined troops, animated
  by the presence and example of the King and Prince, little regarded
  the enemy's vast superiority of numbers, while the Earl of Stair
  made a vigorous charge with the cavalry, among whom were the Scots
  Greys, then under the command of Sir James Campbell, an officer of
  high talents in his profession, and who signalised himself on this
  occasion in a manner which proved him truly worthy the command.
  Unfortunately for his country and the service this meritorious
  officer fell by a cannon shot the succeeding year, at the battle of
  Fontenoy in 1744.

  "In this battle, fought on the 30th of April, than which few have
  been more bloody, the laurel was snatched from the enemy by this
  corps and three others, who covered the British and Hanoverian
  Infantry, under General Lord Ligonier, and that in so gallant a
  manner as to render wholly abortive one of the greatest objects of
  the French commander, for the timid Dutch had retreated, leaving a
  wing of the Allied Army exposed to the enemy, and this, although
  supported by two British battalions.

  "The hazard was great and the moment more critical inasmuch as
  its brave Colonel was killed and his post left defective for a
  considerable time until His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland
  ordered some pieces of cannon to be brought up, at the head of the
  Foot Guards, which soon silenced the enemy's guns, and by exciting
  universal admiration at the General's presence of mind in the midst
  of such danger, the troops were roused to unusual exertions and
  actually took possession of some of their batteries, although, to
  effect this, they were necessarily exposed to a most terrible and
  incessant cannonade. Perhaps the page of history could not produce
  a parallel to the bravery of the British troops in this engagement,
  who, after having stood for upwards of three hours the incessant
  fire of three strong batteries, could drive the French, their
  superiors in point of number, from their lines into their Camp;
  who when thinned in their ranks, tired with slaughter and almost
  sinking beneath their wounds, could break the same host of troops,
  drive them back a second time, and at length make good a safe
  retreat, at the moment when the enemy was reinforced by seven fresh
  battalions."

At the risk of seeming lengthy, I must here add, without pretending to
edit it, a paragraph from Cannon's very scarce record:--

  "A tremendous cannonade was followed by volleys of musketry and
  charges of cavalry. The Greys supported the infantry for some
  time; but at length they were led forward by their Colonel, the
  chivalrous and daring Lieutenant-General James Campbell, against a
  line of French Cuirassiers. Their grey horses and grenadier caps
  rendered them conspicuous--their noble bearing excited admiration.
  Before them appeared the enemy's squadrons, formidable in numbers,
  and bright in polished armour; but undismayed by the opposing ranks
  of war, the Greys raised a loud huzza, and rushed at speed upon
  their steel-clad opponents, who were overthrown and pursued to the
  rear of their own lines....

  "The Greys pursued their adversaries to the banks of the river,
  and captured a White Standard, with which they returned in
  triumph to their own lines, where they received the expression
  of the approbation of their Sovereign, who had witnessed their
  gallantry.... The standard was of white damask, finely embroidered
  with gold and silver; a thunderbolt in the middle, upon a blue and
  white ground; motto, _Sensere Gigantes_."

The following interesting 1747 record I copy from the Manuscript Papers
now preserved by the Greys:--

  "Extract from the Record Book of the Enniskilling Dragoons.

"Signed, +E. M. W. Gres+, Major.

  "1747. The Duke of Cumberland arrived at the Hague on the 15th of
  February. The French made some hostile movements in April. The
  Allied Army were encamped near to Antwerp, their right extending
  to Breschater. The army of the Allies marched 30th of June in
  three columns towards Lonaken, and encamped between that place and
  Ghenck. The French corps of the Count de Clermont occupied the high
  ground from Tongress to Tonggrebech. His Royal Highness the Duke of
  Cumberland and Marshal Bathiani resolved to take possession of the
  camp of Bilsen. On the 2nd of July an action was fought between
  Tongress and Bilsen, near Maestricht, called the battle of Keselt
  or of Lafeldt, or Vol. The British cavalry charged and broke the
  enemy's first line, and afterwards when His Royal Highness was with
  them, charged a second time and broke the enemy again; hereupon the
  enemy made a desperate effort on the centre of the Allies; their
  squadrons penetrated and divided the army.

  "At this juncture the British cavalry, led on by Sir John Ligonier,
  charged the French with so much success that they overthrew all
  before them, but too eager in pursuit of the enemy, received a
  sharp fire from the Foot, which they had posted in a hollow way and
  some hedges, to favour the flight of their horse, by which they
  suffered a good deal; they dispersed, however, that Foot and some
  fresh squadrons which the enemy had sent down upon them, but was
  all in vain whilst the army was divided in two.

  "His Royal Highness, therefore, called the Cavalry off and sent
  word to the Marshal that he should retire towards Maestricht, and
  would move towards Velt Wesel and Lanaken to favour his Retreat.
  This done, he retired the left wing slowly and in good order,
  bringing off all the heavy field artillery. His Royal Highness gave
  the greatest commendation to His Majesty's British and Electoral
  troops, of which there was not a squadron or Battalion which did
  not charge and beat the enemy more than once. The Scots Greys,
  the Duke's, Rothe's, the 6th Inniskilling, and Sir Robert Rich's
  Dragoons, gave the French cavalry a prodigious overthrow and took
  several standards.

  "The Brigade of Scotch and Irish in the French service fought
  desperately, and would have taken the Duke of Cumberland prisoner,
  had not Sir John Ligonier come up with a party of cavalry and
  thereby saved His Royal Highness.

  "The Allies took five standards and seven pair of Colours. In this
  Battle the Regiment suffered severely. The allies passed to the
  eastern side of the Meuse immediately after the Battle of 2nd of
  July. Encamped at Gronfelt. The French laid siege to Bergen Op Zoom:

  "Several sallies and skirmishes. In August the Allies moved nearer
  to Liege. The French had their left towards Tongress and their
  right towards Liege.

  "Bergen Op Zoom taken by the French 16th September.

  "In October the troops went into winter quarters on the Dutch
  Frontier in the neighbourhood of Breda.

  "The Duke of Cumberland and General Ligonier arrived in England
  13th November.

  "20th November five regiments of Foot embarked at Gravesend for
  Flanders."

have made no alterations.--E. A.]




CHAPTER III.


The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed on October 7th, 1748, and the
Greys returned to England, and were stationed at Leicester, Coventry,
and Warwick. By the usual mean and miserable policy, or want of any
policy, the Regiment was at once reduced to 285 officers and men!
(In time of peace, always take care not to be prepared for war.) In
December, 1749, the Regiment went into quarters in Kent, and was
employed on revenue duty on the coast. In 1750 they were in Sussex and
Devon, and in 1751 in Dorsetshire. The Regiment marched into Lancashire
in the spring of 1753; with detached troops in Somersetshire, where
it was stationed during the following year; and in the spring of
1755 proceeded to Northampton and other towns in that part of the
kingdom. Complications now coming to a point about British and French
possessions in North America, the Regiment's establishment was made up
to 357 of all ranks, and very soon a light troop was added, in the same
way as light companies had been added to regiments of infantry.

In the summer of 1755 the Greys occupied quarters in Herefordshire and
in the winter months were dispersed in cantonments in Kent. In the next
spring they marched into Surrey, and afterwards into Dorsetshire, and
in June encamped with several other corps near Blandford.

In April, 1757, they went into cantonments in Essex, staying there four
months, and then going into Suffolk. In October four troops proceeded
to Newmarket.

An expedition was now made ready for a descent on the coast of France,
and the "light troop," commanded by Captain Francis Lindsay, was
ordered on this service.

The following is from the "Weekly Journal," 23 May, 1758:--

  "The nine troops of Hussars (Light Dragoons) belonging to the nine
  regiments of cavalry, are now preparing to go upon this expedition.
  The flower of these Hussars is the troop commanded by Captain
  Lindsay, quartered at Maidenhead, where they have been practising
  the Prussian exercise, and for some days have been digging large
  trenches and leaping over them, also leaping high hedges with broad
  ditches on the other side. Their Captain on Saturday last, swam
  with his horse over the Thames and back again; and the whole troop
  were yesterday to swim the river."

On June 5th, 1758, the Brigade landed on the coast of France about nine
miles from St. Malo, and on the 7th set fire to the shipping in St.
Malo.

The troops having succeeded in this, now came home again.

In August the Greys light troop formed part of another expedition which
captured Cherbourg. After returning to England the light troop was
quartered in towns on the coast of Sussex.

The Greys were among the troops sent to Germany under the command of
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the year 1758, at which time the Duke
of Argyle commanded the Regiment. These troops landed at Embden on the
20th of July and were headed by the Duke of Marlborough and the Lord
George Sackville.

Still did their gallantry and good conduct preserve to them the high
opinion which the Regiment had so justly merited in every conflict to
which its squadrons were exposed.

  "From the "London Gazette," Saturday, September 6th, 1760.

  "+Hague+, Septr. 1st.

  "By the last letters from Prince Ferdinand's Army, which are of
  the 28th past, we have received information that the French under
  Marshall Broglio, left their camp upon the Dymel in the night
  between the 21st and 22nd, marching off by their right, and that
  the Hereditary Prince crossed that river on the 22nd at the head
  of 12,000 men, in order to gain the left flank of the enemy. That
  the advanced troops of that corps came up with their rearguard near
  Zierenberg; and that, after the light troops on each side had been
  engaged with different success, the Hereditary Prince arrived in
  person with the Greys and Iniskilling Dragoons, supported by the
  English Grenadiers, and put an end to the affair in a quarter of an
  hour, by forcing the enemy to a precipitate flight with great loss."

      The "London Gazette," Saturday, September 13th, to Tuesday,
                         September 16th, 1760.

"Prince Ferdinand's Head Quarters at Buhne, Sept. 9.

  "On the 5th past, a very considerable body of the enemy, amounting
  to 20,000 men and upwards, attempted to make a general forage in
  the neighbourhood of Geismar; But Prince Ferdinand, having received
  previous intelligence of their design, crossed the Dymel early
  in the morning of that day, and went in person with a corps of
  troops to oppose them; and though His Serene Highness was much
  inferior in number to the French, yet he took his precautions so
  well, by occupying some advantageous heights, and placing artillery
  there, that he rendered the enemy's attempt totally ineffectual,
  notwithstanding a large portion of their Army was in motion to
  cover the foragers.

  "On the morning of that day likewise, the Hereditary Prince
  (upon intelligence that the volunteers of Clermont and DauphinÃ©,
  consisting each, when compleat, of 600 Horse and 600 foot, were
  cantoned at Zierenberg; and, from the very small distance of the
  French camp at Dierenberg, thought themselves in perfect security)
  went from his camp at Warbourg to Maltzberg, which is not much more
  than a league from Zierenberg, without seeing any of their Posts,
  or meeting any of their Patroles. This made His Serene Highness
  resolve on an attempt to surprise them; for which purpose he
  ordered five Battalions, a Detachment of 150 Highlanders under the
  command of Captain McLeon, and eight squadrons of Dragoons to be
  ready to march at eight at night.

  "They left their tents standing, and passed the Dymel near
  Warbourg; Maxwell's Battalion of Grenadiers, the Detachment of
  Highlanders, and Kingsley's Regiment, forming the Head of the
  Column. These were followed by two other Battalions of Grenadiers
  and by Block's Regiment. The eight squadrons of Dragoons were
  Block's, the Greys, and Iniskillings. At the village of Witzen,
  about a league on the other side of the Dymel, we found all the
  light troops, which were under Major Bulow's command, and whose
  destination was to turn the town of Zierenberg, and to take post
  between it and Durenberg, in order to intercept whoever should
  attempt passing to the enemy's Camp. At the entrance of a large
  wood, near Maltzberg, the Greys and Iniskillings were posted.
  At Maltzberg, a Battalion of Grenadiers. The other Battalion of
  Grenadiers, the regiment of Block, and Block's Dragoons, were
  posted at proper distances between Maltzberg and Zierenberg to
  cover us, in case we had been repulsed and pursued. At a mill,
  about two English miles from the town and within sight of the fires
  of the enemy's grand guards, Maxwell's Grenadiers took one Road,
  Kingsley's Regiment and the Detachment of Highlanders another.
  When we came within less than half a mile of the Town the vedettes
  of their grand guards challenged us, but did not push forward to
  reconnoitre us. Our men marched in the most profound silence.
  In a few minutes we saw the fires of their piquets, which they
  had posted close to the Town. The noise of our trampling over
  gardens gave them the alarm, and they began to fire; upon which
  our Grenadiers, who had marched with unloaded firelocks (as had
  been agreed on), ran on towards the town, pushed the Piquets, and
  having killed the guard at the gate, rushed into the Town, and
  drove everything before them. Never was a more compleat surprize.
  The attack was so sudden, that the enemy had not time to get
  together in any numbers, but began to fire at us from the windows;
  upon which our men rushed into the houses, and for some time made
  a severe use of their Bayonets. They afterwards loaded and killed
  a great many of the enemy, who had mounted their horses. It was
  about two in the morning when we got into the Town, and about
  three the Prince ordered the Retreat, after we had taken M. de
  Norman, Brigadier, who commanded the volunteers of DauphinÃ©, and
  M. de Comeiras, Colonel of those of Clermont, with about 40 more
  officers and 300 private men. The number of killed and wounded is
  very considerable, from an ill-judged resistance of those who were
  in the houses; but in justice to our men, it must be said that
  they gave quarter to all who asked it; and there are several noble
  instances of their refusing to take money from their prisoners, who
  offered them their purses. General Griffin, who went into the Town
  at the head of Kingsley's Regiment, received a thrust in the breast
  with a Bayonet (as it is supposed from one of our own people) upon
  hearing him talk French to a soldier whom he had seized, and who
  would not quit his firelock, but the wound is a very slight one.
  What makes this affair the more satisfactory is that it has not
  cost us ten men, which is wonderful in a night attack, where we
  might have expected to have lost more by our own mistaking friends
  for foes.

  "The behaviour of the Officers and the bravery of the Troops upon
  this occasion deserve the greatest commendation. Lord George Lennox
  was a volunteer in this expedition, and had his horse wounded under
  him by a shot from a window. With our prisoners we brought off two
  pieces of cannon, and had we had time to search the houses the
  number of our prisoners would have been doubled; but as day was
  coming on, and we might have been cut off from Warburg, we returned
  the same way we came, and arrived there at eight in the morning of
  the 6th without being at all molested."

In 1763 a treaty of peace was signed, and as early as February, 1763,
the Greys quitted Germany, and marching through Holland, embarked at
Williamstadt in North Brabant, landed at Gravesend, and proceeded to
Hereford. Soon the light troop, which had remained in England, was
disbanded, but 8 men per troop were now equipped as Light Dragoons.
The establishment was reduced to 213 men! In November the Regiment
marched to Scotland, and were stationed at Dalkeith and Musselburgh;
but soon returned South, and in 1764 were stationed at Manchester and
Warrington. In April, 1765, they marched to Worcester and Pershore. In
1766 they went to Sussex.

At this date "Drummers," who had been on the establishment from the
foundation of the Corps, were ordered to be replaced by "Trumpeters."

In May, 1767, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, and in the winter of
1768 it was in winter cantonments in Lincoln and Boston.

In 1769 they went to Scotland, returning the next year to Warwick,
Lichfield and Stratford-upon-Avon.

The greater part of 1771 was spent in cantonments in Dorsetshire and
Somersetshire. In 1772 the Regiment was stationed at Canterbury,
with detachments on coast duty in Kent. In May, 1773, it marched
into quarters at Greenwich and the neighbouring villages; and on May
22nd King George the Third reviewed the Greys,--expressing his high
admiration of the Regiment's appearance and discipline.

The newspapers of the time describe the day as particularly fine, and
allude to the great crowds assembled to witness "the martial appearance
and correct manÅuvring of this gallant old corps."

The Regiment now went to Ipswich and Bury St. Edmund's, and in the
autumn extended its quarters to Norwich. In 1774 it marched to York,
and again sent detachments on coast duty. In the spring of 1775 it
marched again North, and remained in Scotland until April, 1776.
After this it spent 11 months in Lancashire. Next the Regiment went
to Worcester for a summer station, passing the autumn in Gloucester,
Tewkesbury, Pershore, and Ludlow.

In 1778, when the War of Independence broke out, no heavy cavalry corps
were sent to North America; but the establishment of the Greys was
increased by some 250 men and horses, and 48 of these were equipped as
Light Dragoons. The "light" part of the Regiment now consisted of 6
sergeants, 6 corporals, and 84 private men; and in April, 1779, these
light horsemen were incorporated, with detachments from the 7th, 15th
and 16th Dragoons, into a Regiment which was numbered 21st Dragoons.
During the summer of 1779 the Greys were encamped on Salisbury Plain,
and other Dragoon Regiments with them. In November the Regiment went
into quarters at Marlborough, Chippenham, Colne, and Malmesbury.

In the autumn of 1780 they marched into Worcestershire.

In January, 1781, two troops requisitioned by magistrates on account
of disturbances, marched to Ludlow. In June the Regiment marched into
Dorsetshire.

In 1782 the Regiment was at Durham, and in 1783 went north to Scotland.
In this year, peace having been made with the United States of America,
the Regiment's establishment was reduced to 232 all told.

In 1784 they marched south, and were stationed 11 months in Manchester.

In April, 1785, they went to Worcester.

In the summer of 1786 they occupied extensive cantonments in
Dorsetshire, and early in 1787 four troops were called in to aid the
civil power in Wiltshire. In June the Regiment marched into quarters in
Hampshire.

In April, 1788, they were in quarters near Hounslow, and thence went
to Ipswich, removing in the summer of 1789 to Nottinghamshire and
Lincolnshire. Early in 1790 the Regiment marched into Yorkshire; from
there 3 troops were soon sent to Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in September
the other 3 troops marched to Durham. In the spring of 1791 they
marched to Scotland, returning in the spring of 1792, and quartering in
Lancashire. In December, 1792, an increase of 60 men was ordered.

The French Revolution having broken out, the Regiment was, in 1793,
made up to 9 troops of 54 non-commissioned officers and men each; and
soon 4 troops were ordered to be held perfectly ready for foreign
service.

On January 20th, 1793, Louis the Sixteenth was murdered. The French
envoy was at once ordered to leave England, and on February the 3rd the
Convention declared war against England. The French attacked Holland,
and a united British and Hanoverian force, commanded by the Duke of
York, went to the help of the Dutch.

On July the 9th, 1793, 4 troops of the Greys embarked at Blackwall for
Flanders. The rest were left at Worcester, Tewkesbury and neighbouring
towns. The 4 troops landed at Ostend on July 16th, and marching towards
France joined the army laying siege to Valenciennes. After Valenciennes
had been taken, they were at first occupied in covering the siege of
Dunkirk; but this was soon abandoned, and they were next occupied near
Lisle, and made a successful charge against some French cavalry on the
heights of Cateau Cambresis. In November the 4 troops marched to Ghent.

The 5 troops remaining in England were increased to 80 men each.

In February, 1794, the 4 troops quitted Ghent for Beveren.

On April the 17th, after joining the army on the plains of Cateau, they
supported the infantry attack on the villages of Vaux and PrÃªmont.

At day-break on May the 10th, the army was in position on the heights
in front of Tournay, the Greys being formed in column of troops behind
the left wing. The Bays, Greys, and Inniskilling Dragoons forming one
brigade, advanced in open column of half-squadrons, with the Duke of
York at their head; on approaching the enemy they formed line under a
heavy cannonade and charged.

The following is in the Honourable J. W. Fortescue's account, Vol. IV.,
p. 249, of his splendid new _History of the British Army_:--

"At last, however, a little to the south of Willems, the battalion-guns
of the British infantry came up and opened fire, when the French, after
receiving a few shots, began to waver. The squadrons again charged,
and an officer of the Greys, galloping straight at the largest of
the squares, knocked down three men as he rode into it, wheeled his
horse round and overthrew six more, and thus made a gap for the entry
of his men. The sight of one square broken and dispersed demoralised
the remainder of the French. Two more squares were ridden down, and
for the third time the British sabres had free play among the French
infantry.... Not for eighteen years was the British Cavalry destined
again to ride over French battalions as they rode on this day; and
then Stapleton Cotton was fated once more to be present, leading not a
squadron of Carabiniers, but a whole division of horse to the charge at
Salamanca. But the 10th of May 1794 is chiefly memorable as marking the
date on which the new French infantry showed itself not unworthy of the
old."

In November, 1795, the 4 troops of Greys embarked at Bremen for England
and landed at South Shields on Christmas Eve. From here they went to
Northallerton, and in February, 1796, joined the rest of the Regiment
at Canterbury.

In July of this year the Regiment was encamped near Weymouth; in
September it went into quarters at Dorchester, Bridport, Weymouth, and
Wareham.

Late in 1797 the Regiment marched to Nottingham, Loughborough,
Leicester, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch; in July, 1798, it was encamped
in Windsor Forest, and in September went from there to Birmingham,
Coventry, and Lichfield.

In the summer of 1799 the Regiment went to Dorchester, Bridport, and
Weymouth. A ninth troop was now added, and in April, 1800, a tenth was
added. A force called the Fencible Cavalry was disbanded, and from it
81 men, with 220 horses, were drafted to the Greys.

In October, 1800, the Regiment marched to Salisbury, Southampton,
Blandford, Rumsey, and Portsmouth.

In 1801 the Greys marched to Dorchester.

Now came the inevitable policy of parsimony, and no war being on hand,
the Greys establishment was reduced to 8 troops of 29 officers, 8
quarter-masters, 28 sergeants, 8 trumpeters, and 480 rank and file,
including 10 dismounted men in each troop.

In July, 1802, the Regiment marched to Croydon, Rumsey, and Eastbourne.

The folly of reduction was now shown. War opened with France again in
1803, and the Regiment's strength was brought up to 10 troops. Its
efficiency was also promoted by adding 3 captains, and thus releasing
the field officers from the charge of troops. The establishment now
became 51 officers, 10 quarter-masters, 54 sergeants, 10 trumpeters,
and 1,000 rank and file.

In June, 1803, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, staying there nearly
two years, the period when Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of France,
was hourly expected to attempt an attack on our coast.

In May of 1805 the Greys marched to Ipswich and Colchester.

On Thursday, January 9th, 1806, Lord Nelson was buried in St. Paul's
Cathedral, and two squadrons of the Greys took part in the procession
on this occasion.

Soon afterwards the Regiment marched into Yorkshire and
Northumberland; and the talk of invasion having passed off, the
Regiment was once more reduced, and the establishment became 40
officers, 10 quarter-masters, and 854 non-commissioned officers and men.

In January, 1807, the Regiment marched to Scotland. In June, 1808, the
Regiment sailed to Ireland. In June, 1809, an alteration was made by
substituting a regimental quarter-master and 10 troop sergeant-majors,
in the place of the 10 troop quarter-masters.

In 1810 the Regiment sailed from Dublin for England, and now
occupied quarters in Yorkshire and Lancashire. In the spring of 1813
the quarters of the Regiment were extended to Leicestershire and
Derbyshire. Two troops were left at Birmingham, and in December 8
troops marched to Canterbury, remaining there and at Dover, Deal, and
Hythe.

The following account relates to the review in Hyde Park before the
Prince Regent, the King of Prussia, and the Czar of Russia, on June
21st, 1814, and is from _The Times_ of Wednesday, the 23rd:--

  "It is little less than impossible to keep pace in the public
  journals with all the movements of the illustrious personages
  now in the British metropolis, or to describe the affectionate
  zeal with which they are received.... Our army has now, with
  great reason, become as much our boast as our navy, and therefore
  the display of its merits--of the persons, the horses, the
  accoutrements, of its component parts--ought to excite as great an
  interest as the exhibition of our ships of war and their equipages.
  Their Majesties, we have reason to believe, were as highly
  gratified by the review as British hearts could wish. A detachment
  of the Greys attended the great potentates, accompanied by the
  Hetman Platoff and a small detachment of Cossacks.

  "They were received with the loudest shouts by the populace.
  The Prince Regent, who was accompanied on one side by the King
  of Prussia, and on the other by the Emperor of Russia, was
  greeted with high applause. He was followed by Blucher and a most
  magnificent staff, superbly attired."

In July, 1814, the Regiment was reduced to 8 troops, amounting to 584
officers and men, including 16 dismounted men for each troop. In a few
months the Regiment went into winter quarters at Bristol and Trowbridge.

Early in 1815 Napoleon was once more in France, and the Greys
establishment was again made up to 10 troops, comprising in all 946
officers and men. Six troops were to be held in readiness to go abroad,
and the other four were marched to Ipswich.




CHAPTER IV.


Before giving the several interesting contemporary records of 1815 in
possession of the Regiment, allusion must be made to the two touching
original records now belonging to the Regiment, relating to Colonel
Hamilton, the commanding officer killed at Waterloo. One is a letter
of May 15th, 1793, acquainting a Mr. Anderson that "the King had been
pleased to appoint Jamie a cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons."

The other letter is dated July 10th, 1815, and is from James Swan, 53,
York Place, Edinburgh, to Mr. McLachlane, Writer, Glasgow. The letter
records Colonel Hamilton's (son Jamie's) death.

A folio volume, lettered outside:--

  "Royal Scots Greys, Waterloo, 18th June, 1815, letters, etc.,
  connected with Lieutenant-Colonel Inglis Hamilton, who was killed
  in action, in command of the regiment at Waterloo."

Inside is:--

  "The letters in this book relating to the history of
  Lieutenant-Colonel Inglis Hamilton were presented to the officers
  of the Regiment, on the occasion of the celebration of the
  Bicentenary of the raising of the Regiment, on the 18th of June,
  1881, by the family of the late Peter Mackenzie, Esq., author of
  the 'Reminiscences of Glasgow.' The papers were entrusted to the
  charge of Mr. Mackenzie by the sisters of Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton.

                                "+John W. Hozier+, Lieut.-Colonel.
                                   "Commanding Scots Greys."

  "Royal Barracks, Dublin,
    "18th June, 1881."

  "This book in which the papers are now preserved, was presented by
  Lieutenant-Colonel Hozier."

  "Major-General Hamilton has to acquaint Mr. Anderson that he
  received on Sunday night a card from Lord Amherst, acquainting him
  that the King had been pleased to appoint Jamie a cornet in the
  Royal North British Dragoons, at the same time his Lordship called
  him James Hamilton. How this has happened he cannot say, as the
  General has received no explanation, but can assure Mr. Anderson
  that he gave in his name when in London to the Secretary at War
  Jas. Anderson; he likewise gave in his name on Watson's return from
  Glasgow, my godson James Anderson, since which he has heard little
  until last night, but has wrote this day.

  "If the nomination is given in and past recall, the General hopes
  that Mr. Anderson will agree to it, as it must be of such advantage
  to the young man. Besides, he has to acquaint Mr. Anderson that he
  always intended to leave Jamie something handsome at his death, on
  condition that he bore his name, and will condescend to say, if
  agreed to, that the annual rent in money, bondes, or stock shall
  exceed the rents of Murdiestone when the General's father changed
  his name from Hamilton to Inglis, by virtue of the testator's will.

  "The General wishes that Mr. Anderson will observe that this
  is every day done both in North and South Britain, and was the
  constant practice among the ancients. On these considerations, and
  seeing it will save a thousand pounds and enable him to assist
  Willie and John, which it is the General's purpose to do, he hopes
  that Mr. Anderson will cheerfully acquiss."

  "Murdiestone, 20th May, 1793."


The above letter bears the following most pathetic endorsement:--

                                "MEMOR.
                        "J. A.--15th May, 1793.

  "July 11th, '93. Parted with son James half past five o'clock
  night, at Lark-hall. He was then aged 16 years and seven days. I
  walked to Hamilton that night with a heart full of grief."

The following letter, addressed:--

  "Mr. +H. McLachlane+, Writer, Glasgow.
                  "EdÊ³., 53, York Place,

  "+Sir+,--I recd. your letter of the 7th inst. and with reference
  to a letter I wrote Mr. Une not knowing the address of my lamented
  friend Col. Hamilton's sister, I beg leave to inform you that with
  deep regret I have ascertained the intelligence of the Col.'s
  death to be correct. His bravery was most gallant throughout the
  18th, and he was killed giving a word of command. Several accounts
  agree that latterly in the action he was seen by his men _still_
  commanding with both arms shot off, holding the reins of his
  charger in his teeth. This must have been momentary desperation.
  I saw a letter from an officer in the Greys (Gen. Hamilton of
  Dalziel's son) stating that it was ascertained that on examining
  Col. Hamilton's body previous to his burial on the field of battle
  he had received a shot through his heart, and Sir James Stewart
  showed me a letter from Col. Clark of the Greys mentioning that the
  Colonel's body had been found and had been buried."

       *       *       *       *       *

The letter is signed James Swan. In the margin Major +J. W. Hozier+ has
noted:--

  "Trotter, son of Mr. Trotter of Worton Hall, Edinburgh."

Inserted in this volume are the leaves from "Good Words" of September
1st, 1866, containing "Two Glasgow Stories," "By the Editor."

  "About ninety years ago the 21st, or North British Fusiliers, were
  engaged in the American war, and fighting at Ticonderoga.... The
  Fusiliers were then commanded by Colonel Inglis Hamilton, formerly
  of the Scots Greys, who inherited from a long line of ancestors the
  property of Murdiestoun, in the vicinity of Glasgow.

  "William Anderson, a Glasgow man of excellent character, was a
  private in the 21st, and rose to the rank of Sergeant-Major. He had
  born to him in America two sons, James and John, and two daughters.
  Having been wounded he was discharged with a pension, and with his
  family settled in the Gallowgate of Glasgow.... Colonel Hamilton,
  having attained the rank of Major-General, left the service, and
  with an old sister resided at his estate of Murdiestoun.

  "... One day the General driving in his carriage, saw to his
  surprise, Sergeant-Major Anderson playing with his children on
  the opposite side of the road, and no less to the surprise and
  delight of the old Sergeant, he saw his General, and felt the grasp
  of his affectionate hand. The children remembered the General,
  who delighted with the appearance of James, seized him in his
  arms and tossed him in the air, which so charmed the boy that he
  exclaimed,--Do it again, General; please give me another toss
  over your head. From that day the General's heart was knit to
  Jamie Anderson. He showed the greatest kindness to all the family,
  educating the boys in the grammar school, and afterwards at the
  University; while the girls received the best teaching which the
  boarding schools of Glasgow could then afford.

  "James moreover was taught riding, a pony was provided for his
  daily use; and Murdiestoun became his home almost as much as
  the more humble, but not less happy and contented abode in the
  Gallowgate. This kindness had a purpose in it. In carrying out this
  purpose, the General obtained a commission for 'Jamie' as a Cornet
  in the Scots Greys. The Secretary at War assumed the boy's name to
  be Inglis Hamilton....

  "Years passed. The Cornet behaved like an officer and a gentleman,
  and was the pride of the old General, who had the satisfaction of
  seeing him become Lieutenant-Colonel of his regiment, respected and
  beloved by officers and men. The General in the meantime made his
  will, leaving his property to James and his heirs male....

  "The General died, and according to a request written by him
  and placed in his prayer book, Jamie acted as chief mourner,
  accompanied by the nobility and gentry of the county."

Copies of letters written just previous to the battle of Waterloo, by
F. C. Kinchant, Cornet, 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys); also one
describing his death by treachery during the battle, and the summary
revenge taken therefor by the sergeant of his troop.

  "+My Dear Hall+,

  "I fear you have again an opportunity of calling me an idle
  correspondent. I have certainly delayed writing to you much longer
  than I intended. In truth my time is totally occupied in drills,
  &c. three times a day, an hour and a half each. I rise every
  morning at six and attend at the Riding School till nine.

  "I have already made great progress in the equestrian art.

  "I and a brother Cornet (junior to myself) perform together.

  "The method of riding is altogether different to that of the
  country squires. At present we ride without stirrups, in order
  that we may obtain a firm seat. We must leap the bar, ditches and
  go through all the different evolutions of the field exercise, &c.
  without stirrups, indeed I find I can already ride better without
  their support than with it. So much for horsemanship.

  "The reason I have so much drilling is I much wish to go on service
  and share the honours my comrades are likely to reap.

  "We are in daily expectation of receiving orders to proceed to
  Flanders.

  "The Regiment is without doubt the best disciplined and the most
  crack cavalry corps in the service. I don't think there is a
  private in it under 5 feet 11 inches, and the officers are a fine
  gentlemanly set of fellows. There are only three Scotchmen among
  the officers, but the privates are in general Scotch.

  "The horses are all grey and in excellent condition.

  "Mine is two inches too low but the colonel has passed him for a
  second charger. He has desired I will get one much stronger and
  higher immediately as a first charger, but where I am to find a
  horse of that description I am at a loss to know.

  "It is the general opinion there will be more hard fighting and
  more bloodshed than in any preceding war, as that arch fellow Bony
  (who has been too deep for all our wise heads) will dispute every
  inch of ground with the sword.

       *       *       *       *       *

  "Pray have you been to Easton lately? What does the old gent say of
  the present appearance of things?

  "If we go on service I shall be obliged to call on him for a
  further advance of cash, as I shall have to purchase many essential
  though expensive articles, such as tent and tent equipage, &c., and
  many other things necessary for service.

  "Our dress altogether is extremely rich and consequently costs lots
  of money. The Court dress coat alone is 40 guineas. It is covered
  with lace from head to foot. The jackets are handsome, but they
  only cost Â£15 15_s._ each. Every other part of the equipment is
  equally as expensive.

  "In fact we make a most dashing appearance. I should like much to
  meet the old Buck at Bath or Clifton. I do not think he would know
  his hopeful son....

  "Believe me my dear John your sincerely attached friend

  this scrawl when read!"

  "I have only time to tell you that we received orders yesterday to
  hold ourselves in perfect readiness for foreign service.

  "To-day another order arrived for the regiment to proceed to North
  Fleet (about 30 miles below London) and there embark for the
  Continent. It will be about seven days' march from hence to North
  Fleet. The order and march came so near together that most of us
  are unprovided with tents, camp equipage, canteens, &c., all
  which necessaries I must order from London to meet me by the time
  I arrive at North Fleet. We have been long expecting this move.
  Since I joined I have not had a spare half hour. Three drills a
  day on horseback and on foot I assure you did not a little fatigue
  my bones. However, I trust I am now a tolerable good match for a
  Frenchman.

  "The Regiment is in the finest condition and in the highest spirits
  and most anxious for an opportunity to distinguish itself.

  "+My Dear John+,

  "I have taken the earliest opportunity to inform you of my arrival
  as far as this place. I should have written sooner, but my time
  has been most fully engaged since we landed. We are quartered for
  a day or two in a village contiguous to this town, are in hourly
  expectation of receiving orders to proceed to the frontiers to join
  the army under the Duke of Wellington. There are an immense number
  of troops daily arriving, and the united forces of the Allies, will
  it is stated, in a short time amount to 900,000 men.

  "We are here quite ignorant of the politics of the country. Nothing
  is said of Buonaparte, but he has doubtless many adherents in
  Flanders. Deserters from his army are constantly coming into Ghent.
  They state that they receive neither their rations nor pay. Some of
  the inhabitants seem well inclined towards the English and are what
  may be termed hospitable, but adieu to English comforts.

  "We embarked at Gravesend on the 15th, sailed on the 16th, and
  reached Ostend on the 19th. We had a rough passage the last day and
  night--the wind blowing hard right in our teeth, with snow storms.
  Many of the horses were a good deal bruised, but none sustained any
  material injury. We expect some hard fighting before the business
  will be settled. Never was a Regiment in better condition for
  service than this, both in men and appointments.

  "+My Dear John+,

  "Week after week has passed without my having the gratification of
  hailing your long expected, most welcome letter. I assure you I
  am most anxious to hear from you, having as yet received only one
  letter from old England....

  "My father has not yet replied to the letters I sent him from
  Bristol, but my sister says he intends advancing the money I
  applied for. I shall therefore write to him very soon on the
  subject as my last bills are unpaid in London for camp equipage,
  &c., and the tradesmen are continually dunning for their accounts
  to be settled. Exchange between this country and England is
  extremely low, only 17â francs for a Bank of England Â£1. I shall
  therefore have as little money as possible sent here. We, however,
  do not expect to receive any pay for four months. The Regiment has
  been here about a fortnight. It is a miserable small village, not
  large enough to contain one troop. The remainder, officers and
  men, are quartered at cottages in the neighbourhood. A pig-sty in
  England is a palace to my quarters. Hosts of lice, bugs, fleas, and
  filth of every description, abound in a most extraordinary degree
  in all the habitations of these dirty vagabonds. To counteract,
  however, as much as possible, the unpleasant effects of sleeping
  in such a dirty hut, I have pitched my tent and sleep quite
  comfortably _su Dio_, in a green field totally independent of the
  above-mentioned black backed gentry.

  "The men and women are very plain, with mouths that reach from ear
  to ear, and are extremely ignorant. It is with great difficulty I
  can make them understand my wants as few can speak French, nothing
  but the Flemish is spoken among the lower classes. The only answer
  I can ever obtain is "yaw," in English, "yes."

  "To-morrow we are again reviewed, for the fourth time since we
  landed, by the Earl of Uxbridge, who commands the English cavalry,
  and on Wednesday this regiment will be inspected by the Prince of
  Orange and a Prussian General. I assure you we are considered the
  finest cavalry corps on the continent. Every one wishes to see us,
  and all the Generals that have reviewed us, speak in the highest
  possible terms of the excellent appearance and condition of the men
  and horses. A Prussian General expressed a wish to see an English
  Dragoon Regiment, the Greys were immediately brought forward as a
  specimen. In fact we have every compliment paid us.

  "A few years ago the Regiment behaved most gallantly in this
  country in several actions and I think it is probable they will
  distinguish themselves in this campaign, for I never saw men more
  anxious for an opportunity. You may perhaps think I speak with
  partiality, but I assure you what I have expressed is the real
  matter of fact. We are within about 35 miles of the French army--a
  day's march.

  "The English army will not advance till the Russians, Cossacks,
  &c., come up. There are a great number of Prussian, Hanoverian and
  Belgic troops in this neighbourhood.

  "I am sorry to hear old Blucher has been insulted by some Saxon
  troops. He is a gallant old cock.

  "Whatever the newspapers say of the increasing popularity of the
  Bourbons, you have no idea how much Bonaparte is adored by the
  lower order. There is scarce a house here from which there is
  not one or two young men now serving in the French army, and the
  deserters are by no means so numerous as the papers would persuade
  us.

  "The French are collecting a very large force on the frontiers. At
  Lisle they have near 40,000 men, at Valenciennes and other places
  they are also very strong. It is the unanimous opinion of the army
  that we shall have some very hard fighting before we reach Paris.
  Much will depend on the first battle. It is generally supposed we
  shall advance in the course of a week and that hostilities will
  commence immediately.

  "I trust the next time I write to you we shall be on the road to
  the French Capital.

  "I am sorry to say the horse I bought in London has turned out very
  bad. I shall be obliged to send to England for another. The grey
  I took from Easton is a very promising horse, but is rather too
  slight for my weight.

  "I must now bid you adieu.

  "Give my kindest regards to all the family at Cockshut.

  "+Dear Sir+,

  "In the course of a short excursion which I was obliged to make
  last week thro' the lower part of Lancashire, I met at the Rectory
  house, Middleton, with Dr. Hardie, a young Scotch physician of
  considerable eminence in his profession at Manchester, where he
  practises. The battle of Waterloo being accidentally mentioned,
  Dr. H. amused myself and the rest of the party after supper with
  various anecdotes of the gallantry and success of Sergeant Ewart
  of the Scots Greys, who performed prodigies of valour on that day
  and whose good fortune it was to be the captor of one of the three
  French Eagles that were taken during the battle.

  "To a remark made by one of the party that he supposed Ewart
  must be very proud of the honour of having taken a French Eagle,
  Dr. H. observed that he always seemed to speak of it with much
  indifference, and that when once asked the name of the regiment
  to which the Eagle belonged, he answered, with much sangfroid,
  'The Invincible or the like.' The only exploit, Dr. H. observed in
  continuance, of which Ewart appears to be proud, is the summary
  revenge which he had an opportunity of taking for the death of Mr.
  Kinchant, who was the cornet of his own troop.... On the morning
  of the 18th, a little before 12 o'clock, the Scots Greys were
  ordered to charge a body of French infantry at some distance,
  which order they instantly proceeded to execute in a column of two
  deep, Sergeant Ewart in this charge being the front man of Cornet
  Kinchant. Ewart, on reaching the enemy, immediately singled out
  a French officer, whom, from being a very expert swordsman, he
  soon disarmed and was on the point of cutting him down, when Mr.
  Kinchant, on hearing the officer crying out, 'Ah, mercy, mercy,
  Angleterre,' said, 'Sergeant, Sergeant, spare his life, and let
  us take him prisoner.' Ewart considering that moment as a period
  for slaughter and destruction, and not the proper time for taking
  prisoners, replied, 'As it is your wish, sir, it shall be done.'
  (I ought to have said that the French officer, prior to Mr. K.'s
  address to the Sergeant, had cried that he had surrendered and
  was their prisoner and had dropped his sabre.) Mr. K. to whom the
  French officer had delivered up his sword, addressed him in French
  and ordered him to move to the rear. Ewart was preparing to proceed
  in the charge when he heard the report of a pistol behind him, and
  turning round, from a suspicion of some treachery, the first object
  which met his eye was Mr. K. falling backwards over his horse,
  apparently in a lifeless state, and the French officer attempting
  to hide his pistol under his coat. Indignant at such a dastardly
  act, Ewart instantly wheeled round, and was again entreated by this
  villain for mercy in the same supplicating terms as before. The
  only answer which he returned was, 'Ask mercy of God, for the deil
  a bit will ye get at my hands,' and with one stroke of his sabre,
  severed his head from his body, leaving it a lifeless trunk on the
  field of battle."

  "We were quartered in small villages between Brussels and Ghent,
  and chiefly in farm houses.

  "I went to bed in my farm house about twelve o'clock on the night
  of the 15th of June 1815, and was scarcely asleep when the trumpets
  sounded the turn out: in an instant we were out of bed, the clothes
  out of the washtub, and in a short time we were ready to march:
  long indeed before orders came to tell us to what point our march
  was to be directed. At length an order came which directed us to
  proceed to Ninove, where we should receive further orders. We
  were soon there: but the day was gone, and it was dark, and the
  firing had entirely ceased before we reached the army, having been
  repeatedly halted on the road during the day, from an apparent want
  of knowing where to go, and at a time too when the French Cavalry
  were charging our Infantry with considerable and unusual success.

  "We encamped in a clover field for the night. A few of us went to
  a village not far off, which had been completely plundered: we
  there met with some soldiers of the Highland Brigade, who gave us
  a most dismal account of the manner in which the French Cavalry
  had attacked them on the previous day. Never having before seen
  our army other than victorious, we felt rather dispirited at
  these accounts, and had not Buonaparte, with his characteristic
  selfishness, sent for the division which ought to have supported
  Ney, and which division never fired a shot during the day, there
  can be little doubt that the battle, instead of being a drawn one,
  must have turned out positive, and with the aid of his cavalry,
  of which we had none, Napoleon would have completely defeated the
  allied troops.

  "On this day Buonaparte kept his own opposed to our army,
  notwithstanding he neutralized one of his whole divisions, and he
  totally defeated the Russian army with a loss, according to their
  own accounts, of twenty-five thousand men, as their total loss as
  returned by themselves was upwards of thirty-three thousand: and
  they could not at Wavre and Waterloo have lost five thousand men.

  "The next morning we received orders to retire, and to cover the
  retreat of the army into the lines at Mont St. Jean. The infantry
  retired by the high road: the cavalry were formed in line: and the
  different brigades fronted alternately to prevent the advance of
  the enemy's cavalry and cannon.

  "Notwithstanding the torrents of rain which fell, the French
  continued to press us closely: their light cavalry charged ours
  on the road and drove them back: when Lord Uxbridge, seeing them
  do so, charged at the head of a regiment of the Life Guards and
  completely upset them, they being unable to stand against the
  superior weight of the men and horse of the household troops. At
  this moment it rained in such a way as I never saw either before
  or since: it rained as if the water were tumbled out of tubs:
  there was also a good deal of thunder with it. Some of the hussars
  that were driven in upon us were so covered with mud that it was
  impossible to distinguish their features. The ground was so soft
  that at every step our horses sank half way to the knees: and
  in several places, in our passing over fallow land, it had the
  appearance of a lake, the rain falling upon it faster than it
  could either be absorbed or run off. It continued to rain and we
  to retire till we halted for the night in the position of Mont St.
  Jean: we were placed in bivouac at the distance of three hundred
  yards from the front of a farm house which lay between us and the
  village of Waterloo. The firing of cannon continued till it was
  dark: but as it was on the other side of the hill we saw nothing
  of what passed, hearing merely the cannonade. It continued to rain
  and thunder during the whole of the night: being hungry and cold,
  and wet through to the skin, we passed a most wretched night: the
  ground upon which we lay was a fallow upon which it was impossible
  to lie: we therefore obtained some straw at the farm house: we
  found there also some wood with which we made a fire, although from
  the rain it was difficult to keep it burning....

  "In spite of the rain we slept pretty soundly, lying at our horses'
  heads, they being formed in line, and linked together, but we were
  repeatedly awoke during the night, by their taking fright at the
  lightning and thunder, at the same time advancing over us! but no
  one was hurt! and as the nights in the middle of summer are short,
  we arose with the day break: a miserable looking set of creatures
  we all were--covered with mud from head to foot--our white belts
  dyed with the red from our jackets, as if we had already completed
  the sanguinary work, which we were soon about to begin.

  "(Sir W. Ponsonby) the General who commanded the brigade, had also
  commanded our brigade in the Peninsula, and as I was the only
  subaltern in it whom he knew, he asked me to be with him on the
  17th and on this day also. This was just what I wished, for a man
  sees more, and suffers less in action when on the Staff, than with
  a regiment, being obliged in the latter case to stand still and be
  shot at, while in the former he is constantly on the alert carrying
  orders, and seeing and hearing everything that is going on.

  "When the General appeared on the ground I joined him, his
  Aide-de-Camp being at Brussels, whither the General had sent
  him, not expecting the action to begin so early if at all that
  day: his major of brigade and an officer who acted as _extra
  Aide-de-Camp_, were however with him.

  "We proceeded, after we had looked at the brigade, to the top of
  the hill, leaving the brigade drawn up close at the bottom of
  it. When we reached the summit we found the Duke of Richmond and
  one of his sons, as amateurs in plain clothes, with a number of
  officers, having their glasses on the look out for the Prussians:
  but we could see nothing of them, although we were on the extreme
  left of our army. Someone thought he saw a Prussian picquet at
  the foot of some trees near a wood, and for a time we were all of
  the same opinion--so fondly do people's hopes make things appear
  in the desired light: but there was no Prussian picquet, and
  the whole party seemed much dispirited. At this moment occurred
  a circumstance not mentioned by any writer whose account of
  the battle of Waterloo I have read: Buonaparte appeared in the
  front of his troops, and the loudest cheering began on the left
  of the French, and ran along their whole line. I confess that I
  never before felt so disheartened: it had evidently a powerful
  effect upon all present, but not one of our party said a word
  about it: nor was any attempt at a reply to it made on our side,
  by the troops near us: they were however chiefly Belgians, with
  the Highland Brigade, and some of the other regiments, which had
  suffered severely on the 16th.

  "At this time we did not know whether we were to fight that day or
  not: for having retired the whole of the day before, we thought as
  the Prussians were not to be seen, that we should again retreat,
  and seeing, or rather hearing by their shouts, that the French were
  in such spirits, ours were not enlivened by the circumstance, but
  the very reverse.

  "However, immediately afterwards the cannonade began on the right
  and increased every minute, till it was opposite to us, a gentle
  breeze wafting the smoke of the French guns towards us, which
  wholly prevented our seeing anything in front of us. Our brigade
  continued drawn up at the bottom of the hill, and I was sent to
  desire the commanding officers of the different regiments to draw
  them up as close to the hill as possible, as they began to suffer
  both from shells and shot, the effects of the cannonade....

  "The cannonade now greatly increased, and under cover of the
  smoke from both their cannon and our own, the French advanced the
  division the Count D'Erbon,[2] who had by this time got close
  to our infantry, who opened their fire upon them: but the enemy
  much more powerful in numbers continued to push on. Our general
  observing what was about to take place, immediately sent me down
  to bring up the brigade with all speed. I did so: the general met
  us just before we reached the summit of the hill: had we been five
  minutes later, it would have been too late to have effected what
  we did, as the French had charged our infantry with the bayonet,
  who fled through the intervals of our squadrons, but immediately
  rallying, advanced again with us to the hedge, a little way down
  the hill, where they fired a volley at the French, when they were
  close to each other. Our three regiments of dragoons were not quite
  in line: the ---- Dragoons were on the right, and some yards in
  advance, so that the general placing himself in front of them, they
  charged a little before the other regiments did: the French gave
  us only a partial volley, being in some disorder in consequence of
  their previous exertions against our infantry, and from having no
  idea of our brigade being so near at hand. We accordingly _went
  right through them_: not a horse, as is usually the case, went
  round from the fire, and the enemy threw down their arms.

  [2] I make no attempt to alter the wording.--E. A.

  "The other two regiments came up in succession, but were a little
  delayed by the hedge: we again charged--the general riding along
  the whole line to the left of the brigade--so that we saw the
  whole three regiments charge: the result in each instance the
  same--namely--the enemy throwing down their arms, and begging their
  lives.

  "In this conflict two eagles were taken, one by the ---- Dragoons,
  and the other by ---- Dragoons.

  "After passing through and killing, wounding, and making prisoners
  the whole of the advanced column of the French, we ought to have
  stopped and re-formed the brigade: but our men were not contented
  with what they had done: they still went on. The General, his
  aide-de-camp and I, got however about thirty of them collected
  together, in the hope of reassembling all who remained of those
  who had come on: for a great many, particularly of the officers,
  had remained with the prisoners: when Colonel of the ---- Dragoons
  came past us at full gallop, with about twenty men of his regiment
  following him: in a second all the men which we had collected
  set off in the same direction. In the hopes of stopping them we
  followed and passed between the columns of the French infantry,
  when their red lances closed behind us. One of the red lancers put
  his lance to my horse's head, I made a cut at his arm as I passed
  him; and as I did not look behind me to see whether I had struck
  him or his lance, I should not have known that I had cut his arm,
  had I not in recovering my sword thrown the blood on my white pouch
  belt.

  "On inspecting the sword, I saw that I had succeeded in wounding
  the lancer and possibly thus saved my own life. My fears were, when
  I saw him thrust at my horse's reins that he would shoot me with
  his pistol, having heard of the red lancers sometimes doing so.

  "Upon getting quite clear of the French, the first person I saw was
  Captain ---- our General's extra aide-de-camp, who had lost sight
  of the General some minutes before I had, and a little way before
  us was Captain ---- of my regiment who had been with me in
  the ---- Dragoons in Spain. He returned to his regiment to collect
  his troops: and the aide-de-camp and I sought for assistance with
  the view of recovering the General, and such other of our officers
  and men who were in the hands of the French. I went to Lord E. R.
  S. who commanded the Life Guard Brigade, and found him alone with
  the exception of Lieutenant M. and Colonel Harvey of the 14th.

  "Lord E. R. S. said to me, 'You see Mr. ---- I can do nothing for
  you.' Upon this I went to a regiment that afterward ran off the
  field altogether, and asked the Colonel in French, to advance,
  and that I would show him where our General was prisoner; but he
  declined moving, saying he had no orders; and he was right, as it
  would have been in vain to make the attempt.

  "A little further to the left, I found Sir J. Vandeleur's brigade
  in column of divisions and an old brother officer of mine in the
  ---- Dragoons, was riding in front of the General giving him
  advice. 'No orders' was again the reply to my request. I then
  joined my regiment.

  "After being once more in the form of a regiment, we retired
  to a situation behind a wood where the enemy's shot and shells
  passed over us: here the regiment, about three hundred strong, was
  re-formed under the command of Colonel ----; we were then marched
  up to the slaughter afresh, and placed nearly in the centre of the
  enemy. On our right was the first brigade of cavalry, about the
  same in number as ourselves. On each side of us were some regiments
  of infantry formed in squares--some Hanoverian, some British.

  "Repeatedly during the evening we retired, either by orders given,
  or voluntarily after the charges were made. But whenever we were
  out of the fire of the enemy we faced about and resumed our former
  position.

  "The infantry squares did the same, but were also brought back
  to their positions; and I observed the officers in some of the
  Hanoverian regiments exerting themselves to the utmost to keep
  their men in order. We were twice led on by the Earl of Uxbridge,
  and charged the squares of the French infantry opposed to us, but
  were as often repulsed, losing about half our number every time.

  "The first time we charged, the first brigade of cavalry on our
  right charged at the same moment, and having received the fire of
  their square of infantry before we did ours, they wheeled about and
  charged as we advanced: so great was the confusion that the General
  commanding them rode up against me, I being on the left of our
  brigade, and he in the centre of his.

  "I said 'Bad work this.' He shook his head, which I construed into
  'It's all over with us.' Just as this occurred, the French square
  opposite to us fired, and a great many of both brigades fell. This
  reminded me of an old Scotch poacher who always waited till two
  partridges 'clipt' before he fired, by clipt he meant, came so near
  that their wings touched each other.

  "At the conclusion of the last of these charges the Earl of
  Uxbridge was shot in the leg; we saw him lifted off his horse
  and carried off the field by six men, Captain H. Seymour walking
  at their head. At this time the action was evidently all against
  us, the enemy's infantry were steady in their squares; but their
  heavy cavalry was as much reduced in number as our own: they
  however sent out their skirmishers, who rode close up to us and
  fired their pistols in our men's faces, who at last got in some
  degree unmanageable, and fired their carbines in return over their
  horses' heads at the French, and it was with some difficulty that
  we prevailed upon them to put up their carbines. At this moment
  one of our men was shot dead. We retired about twenty yards, the
  dead man at the same time being left sitting on his tired horse,
  quite upright, yet completely dead. Fearing that such a spectacle
  might have a bad effect upon the men, he was taken off his horse
  and carried to the rear; but I shall never forget his singular and
  horrible appearance while he remained in the position in which he
  was killed.

  "During the evening we repeatedly retired to the bottom of the
  hill, and as we supposed out of the reach of the fire of the enemy:
  but even here, towards the close of the battle, we had men killed
  and wounded: a pretty strong proof that the enemy had gained the
  summit of the hill, and therefore crowned our position! Why they
  did not advance further I cannot say; but it may be presumed that
  they were without any further order, and that probably their
  superior officers were killed or wounded, and the other officers
  that they had fulfilled their orders having gained the top of our
  position.

  "As it got dusk we could plainly perceive the flashes of the
  Prussian guns in the rear of the French army as we looked over it
  towards the left. This may give a tolerably good idea of the time
  at which the French retired: it was eight o'clock, and the victory
  to all appearance was then quite undecided.

  "During nine hours we had been exposed to a fire, which had, by
  this time, reduced our brigade from about fifteen hundred strong in
  the morning to a mere skeleton of _thirty-three officers and men_,
  the number we mustered when we encamped for the night!

  "It was after nine o'clock at night when the French gave way,
  and our whole line advanced: we, as well as the first brigade of
  cavalry, were now such mere handfuls, that, of course, we could
  do nothing, but followed slowly in the rear of others. We heard
  firing, but it was too dark to see anything clearly: we heard also
  huzzas as the different charges were made by our light cavalry upon
  the retreating enemy. We continued to advance along the right of
  the road by which the French retired, and passed by many cannon and
  waggons which they had abandoned, when I heard some English voices
  calling out 'Are these the Dragoons?' Upon which I answered 'Yes.'
  'Then' continued the voice 'here is Captain ---- of the Dragoons
  badly wounded,' upon which I immediately sent one of the men of his
  regiment, and one of the men of my own, with him to Brussels. I
  heard nothing more of him for four years, further than that he had
  got quite well, till going to visit some of my relations at * * *
  in the east of Scotland, I found him quietly settled there, and in
  the belief that his life had been saved by a French officer.

  "When we halted for the night I was sent with a Cornet of the
  regiment to the village of Waterloo to collect the stragglers, and
  bring them up the next day. On my way to Brussels I overtook on the
  road Captain P---- of the horse artillery, and rode with him into
  the town. He was so kind as to inform a cousin of mine in the same
  corps that I was safe; and thus my friends heard through him, that
  I was neither killed nor wounded.

  "Upon entering into a large house at Waterloo we found every room
  in it filled with either the dead or the dying. I was glad to get
  a chair, and sat down at a table in a large room, in every corner
  of which were poor creatures groaning. The master of the house
  having brought us a piece of bread and a bottle of wine, we began
  to talk over the events of the day: and as he had been for years
  a soldier of Buonaparte's himself, we found no lack of subjects
  for conversation. After we had finished our bread and wine, which
  we enjoyed very much notwithstanding the room was full of poor
  wounded human beings, we retired to a hay loft for the night, which
  we passed in profound repose. In the morning we saw the Belgians
  completing the plunder of a number of baggage waggons, which stood
  in the yard of the house. Here some of our men joined us, and my
  private servant came up from the rear to look for my body, he
  having been informed by two different officers of the brigade whom
  he met on their way to Brussels the evening before, that I was
  killed, assuring him that they had seen me lying on the field of
  battle before they left it.

  "I saw on my left, during one of the many times that we were in
  some confusion, a soldier of the ---- Dragoons whose cheek, just
  as I looked at it, opened, while I felt a ball pass close to my
  lips,--the man immediately fell off his horse and I saw no more of
  him.

  "Several years afterwards I inquired of the Surgeon of his
  regiment, and found that he had recovered with the loss of his
  teeth on both sides, but that no injury was done either to the
  upper or lower jaw, the ball having passed between them. The man's
  name was Pye, the son of an English clergyman, who had left his
  home and enlisted as a dragoon--he was probably a relation of
  Southey's predecessor, the poet laureate of that name. After I had
  got as many of our men ready to march as were in the village of
  Waterloo, we were just setting off when we were joined by a party
  from Brussels under the command of a senior officer to me, who
  had gone there to dinner the day before we proceeded to join the
  regiment, taking the field of battle on our way, where we found the
  dead officers of the regiment and buried them, and then proceeded
  on. But we did not come up with the regiment till the day after
  when we found it encamped for the night, and my troop without an
  officer."

  "+Dear Captain+,

  "Till this day, I have had no time to write to you. You must have
  received e'er this the accounts of what happened on the 18th,
  the slaughter of both armies has been terrible; we have lost
  three-fourths of our officers in killed and wounded, 200 men, and
  nearly 800 horses, which was a pretty day's work. The Grays took
  an Eagle, and the Royals another. I was Orderly Officer to General
  Ponsonby, and was with him till he fell, the aide-de-camp and I
  then cut our way through the enemy who had got into our rear.

  "The first thing we did in the morning was to charge a column of
  French infantry who had forced the left centre of our position,
  supported by the Cuirassiers and some of the Imperial Guard; they
  had just driven the Belgians from the heights and got possession
  of six guns, when Ponsonby led on the Brigade in line; they
  immediately halted, fired a volley which dropped a few of us, not a
  man or horse went about, and in a minute we were in the middle of
  them; those to the rear of the column still continued to fire at
  us. After killing I can't tell what number, we made all the rest
  prisoners, about 3,000, which were immediately sent to the rear.
  Nothing could stop the men; they went on, took a great many of the
  enemy's guns, and then, instead of halting, charged the Lancers and
  Cuirassiers. At this moment I lost sight of the General, who was
  killed, and cut my way to the rear, we being completely overpowered
  by a fresh column of Infantry firing upon us and by the Cuirassiers
  and Lancers having by this time rallied. We then retired and three
  squadrons were formed, nine in the Brigade. We were then led to
  the centre of the Army, where the battle became dreadful. We then
  charged a square of Infantry on our left, and the Life Guards on
  our right; between the two were formed the French Cuirassiers, and
  each flank of our two Brigades rested on a square of Hanoverian
  Infantry. At this moment everyone thought the battle lost, when we
  charged and the Life Guards and one half of our men were destroyed.
  We threw the French into some confusion. The two Brigades, the Life
  Guards and ourselves, were then formed into one squadron of about
  50 file, and we again charged the Cuirassiers in front of us; after
  which we stood, and the French did the same, and fired at each
  other with our carbines, not being more than forty yards from each
  other, both afraid to advance for fear of the Infantry giving way.
  The French then brought up their guns close to us, and our guns
  came up also and fired grape shot, the French throwing something
  like broken glass amongst us, at least it seemed so, which made
  some dreadful wounds. The Prussians fired the right of the French
  and they gave way; all our light cavalry then charged, and we
  pursued them as long as we could see them.

  "At the end of the night I was sent to collect what men I could
  that had gone off with the wounded, and all that were left with the
  regiment was 16 officers and men.

  "I buried 8 officers the next day. Trotter was the first, he was
  shot through the heart; I have written to his brother-in-law, and
  said I would pay his bills and remit home the money that arose
  from his things being sold. I have bought Colonel Hamilton's
  horse, which is a very fine one, 5 years old and fit to carry 15
  stone, for Â£55; he refused Â£100 for him often. When the bills for
  Trotter's things are given, I shall send them either to you or the
  agent. I lost some of my things, many officers their whole baggage.
  The Belgian cavalry ran off to Brussels, saying the Army was
  defeated, and took our baggage from the men by force; such a scene
  never was witnessed; the road at last got blocked with waggons,
  and the Brunswick Hussars and the Belgians seized upon everything.
  Let me hear from you as soon as possible. Write to my father when
  you get this and say I am well. I shall write you next from Paris,
  which is only 100 miles off, and with love to the children,

Letter from Cornet Clape (age 16), Scots Greys, to his Mother a week
after the Battle of Waterloo.

  "+My dear Mother+,

  "I am afraid my long silence may have occasioned you some
  uneasiness, particularly as the list of killed and wounded was so
  long making its appearance. I would have written the day after the
  battle, but where could I find pen and ink, in the middle of a
  cornfield that was occupied the night before by the enemy.

  "I have certainly delayed writing to you this week, as I wanted to
  date my letter from Paris, which we have been expecting to enter
  every day. As you must now be certain that I have escaped without
  a broken head, and, as to my health, I could not enjoy better, you
  may perhaps wish for the history of our proceedings since we left
  Dunderhauten.

  "On the morning of the 15th we were roused from a most comfortable
  sleep by the sound of Bugles, and noise of Sergeants crying 'Turn
  out,' 'Turn out!' We understood that the enemy had Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  in some
  fear of our pickets, and that we were to march about 15 miles,
  which we did, when we were ordered to move on with all possible
  speed to the field of action. We could hear the firing distinctly.
  We got to Ne----lles about nine at night. The firing had almost
  ceased, they were bringing in the wounded by hundreds. We arrived
  on the field of Battle at 12 o'clock, where we bivouacked, after
  having marched upwards of 50 miles. I rolled my cloak round me,
  and laid down in some rye, where I slept as sound as ever I did in
  my life. On the morning of the 17th the firing commenced early,
  chiefly skirmishing. We could not see much of it, as we were
  covered by some rising ground. About 12 the Cavalry and Artillery
  took up positions upon the heights, to cover the retreat of the
  Infantry. We commenced our march in their rear about 4 o'clock,
  going through Jenappes: the rain fell in torrents. We soon after
  moved into the cornfields, where we what they called shewed a
  front, retiring, then fronting again. It was here that I first
  heard the whizzing of a Ball (there is really something very grand
  about it). They were coming pretty fast and very near us: however
  we had not a man killed, or wounded. At 7 we halted. The firing
  had ceased. We had touched nothing since we left Dunderhau--but a
  little bread and some Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â . Luckily we were near a very large
  farm house, that supplied us with wood and straw. Such a scene of
  destruction I never before witnessed. Ploughs, Harrows, Chairs,
  Tables, everything that would burn was brought out to make fires.
  The straw was unthrashed. Old sows, little pigs, calves and cows,
  all shared the same fate. I got a calves kidney, and although it
  was not dressed in style (for one half of it was raw) I made a very
  dainty meal of it.

  "Oh: the night: what could be more uncomfortable. It began raining
  again at 10, and we had nothing but our cloaks to cover us, which
  were soaked in half an hour. On the morning of the 18th, the clouds
  began to break, the sun made his appearance, and with good fires
  we soon got dry. At 10 the firing commenced, we then moved to the
  bottom of the Hill, where Colonel Hankins (?) Horse came down with
  him crossing a ditch: he was severely hurt: we were just in the
  range of the 12 Pounders. We were ordered up the Hill, and after 3
  hours, charged the enemy in the finest style possible. The men were
  only too impetuous, nothing could stop them, they all separated,
  each man fought by himself. I received a bullet from a Frenchman
  not 20 yards from me: it went through my cloak, and lodged in my
  saddle, which it has completely spoiled. I was the last person with
  Colonel Hamilton, who was just like a madman. He was crying 'Halt,
  Halt, the Greys,' when there was none to be seen. He then galloped
  completely into the French Lines, where I thought it time to leave
  him; and make the best of my way back, which by the greatest good
  fortune I effected. If we had been supported by the Light Dragoons,
  we should have lost very few, and done three times the execution.
  After we had collected all we could of the two Brigades, we retired
  behind a wood, where we remained till 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
  when we were ordered to the right. Talk of the charge, I say it
  was a farce to this; this tried a soldier: we were formed upon a
  hill facing the enemy, receiving his whole force of Artillery and
  Musketry, without being able to return a shot. Really the Bullets
  came as thick as Hail, the men were dropping on all sides, here we
  were until half-past seven, diminishing every moment. We seemed
  to be placed there only to be shot at, and the enemy threatening
  to charge us every instant with 6 times our number. We thought
  all was lost, yet all resolved to stand to the last. How can I
  express, my dear Mother, what we felt at seeing the Light Dragoons
  and Artillery come up, and in an instant saw the whole French Army
  in a rout. I must leave it to your own imagination. Our Regiment
  was only 36 strong when we marched to this Mount, when we left it
  we could only muster 14. Colonel Clarke had two horses shot under
  him, and was wounded himself. Major Vernon was wounded. Major
  Cheney had five horses shot under him, and kept mounting the fresh
  ones with the same coolness that he would had they been at his own
  stable door. My old mare received three slight wounds. One was a
  bullet through her ear. Poor Whindham was shot through the foot in
  the charge, he is doing well. What a scene did the field of action
  present to our view. The wounded groaning, the dead cut up in a
  most hideous manner. Horses standing upon three legs, you could not
  go a step without stumbling over something. We that night occupied
  the very ground that the enemy had bivouacked upon the previous
  night, and much obliged to them we were for the huts they had left
  us. Since that time we have been taking forced marches, and are now
  quartered at N----, six miles from Paris. Sergeant Ewart of the
  Greys took the Eagle."

  "+Dear General+,

  "After a long silence on my part I shall attempt to give you a
  short extract of our late movements. No doubt ere this time you
  will have seen the _Gazette_ containing a list of the killed and
  wounded of the Greys on the 18th ultimo. I fancy it's much greater
  than has ever occurred since it was a regiment. We took into the
  field that day three squadrons above sixty files each. Now we
  muster _one_ of little more than that number. I fear many of the
  men and horses wounded, will never be again fit for service. Poor
  Colonel Hamilton led the regiment in grand stile into action. You
  know him, more than courage is required on such occasions.

  "Major-General Ponsonby who commanded the Brigade fell early in the
  action, as did Colonel H.; but which of them fell first, the former
  being in the centre of the Brigade, and we being on the left, I do
  not know which of them was first killed.

  "No regiment could behave better than the Greys, Sergeant Ewart
  took an Eagle, and the Royals another, which I believe were all
  that were taken, but not one word in the Despatch by whom taken,
  indeed the Despatch is extremely cold, and which is observed as
  such by everyone here, that has seen it. The Heavy Brigade are
  mentioned as having done their duty--the first consists of 2
  Regiments, Life Guards, Blues, and first Dragoon Guards. The 2nd,
  second and sixth Dragoons: the Hussars and Light Dragoons had
  little or anything (_sic_) to do except look on. Sergeant Ewart cut
  down the officer and two soldiers before he could get possession of
  the Eagle.

  "Hankin's horse fell with him at the commencement of the charge, we
  saw nothing more of him for that day, had he remained a short time
  in the field he must have been killed from his been (_sic_) so very
  inactive that the French Lancers immediately got into our regt.
  after each charge, he having no reserve he would certainly have
  been destroyed, the Light Dragoons this time might have been made
  extremely useful.

  "Colonel Hankin's horse also fell with him twice on the 17th, when
  we in our turn covered the retreat of the British Army, which was
  done under a most tremendous fire of cannon from the enemy, the
  First Dragoons only lost one man, that was all, Lord Uxbridge's
  Hussars[3] (the 7th) were to have been the last and were so placed,
  but from some cause or other, behaved not very well, indeed his
  Lordship said in front of the first Life Guards, that he must call
  upon them to advance _for that his own regiment had deserted him_.
  The Life Guards charged a mass of Lancers on the _chasee_ (_sic_),
  and which they tumbled over like rats and the road covered with
  them and their horses.

  [3] This Regiment no longer exists.--E. A.

  "It is quite impossible to describe in a letter the battle of the
  18th. The carnage is far beyond belief.

  "The enemy fought most fureyously, indeed they fought with halters
  round their necks as well as their Master. The heavy Cavalry was
  the admiration of the whole army, they bore down everything that
  came in their way.

  "I am pretty certain that had it not been for their exertions on
  that day, we should not now have had possession of the French
  Capital, with the aid of part of the Prussians at the close of
  the day, and which came very seasonably, not only to complete a
  hard day's work, but to follow a routed enemy which they did to
  perfection. I went over a part of the field of Battle next morning
  where we had principly been engaged, with the view of getting
  removed such of the wounded of the Greys as remained, and also to
  bury the officers, the former had all been removed, and the latter
  I saw put under ground as well as we could. Poor Carruthers died
  next day of his wounds. The men wounded say that they received
  their wounds after they were taken prisoners, this from their
  horses being killed, from which it would appear that the French
  expected no quarter was to be given on either side: the field is
  far beyond my power to describe, it was literally covered with men
  and horses, &c., &c.

  "I beg you will excuse this horrid scrawl as I find that I am not
  competent to give even a faint description of this bloody battle.

  "Clark had a horse killed under him and himself wounded. Poole
  had a horse killed and himself for some time a prisoner. Verner a
  horse shot through the head and himself through the shoulder and
  apparently by the same ball. Wemyss a horse shot. Cheney had five
  horses (only one his own, and the rest troopers), his own died next
  day. My horse shot through the shoulder and my cloak like a ridle
  from musket balls. Indeed only two officers escaped without being
  touched either themselves or horse.

  "As Colonel Clark is now likely to succeed to the command of the
  Regiment."

  "Sergeant Weir, of the Scots Greys, was pay-sergeant of his troop,
  and as such might have been excused serving in action, and perhaps
  he should not have been forward, but on such a day as Waterloo he
  requested to be allowed to charge with the Regiment. In one of
  the charges he fell mortally wounded, and was left on the field.
  Corporal Scot, of the same regiment (who lost a leg) asserts that
  when the field was searched for the wounded and slain, the body of
  Sergeant Weir was found with his name written on his forehead by
  his own hand dipped in his own blood. This his comrade said he was
  supposed to have done that his body might be found and known, and
  that it might not be imagined he had disappeared with the money of
  the Troop."




CHAPTER V.


The Greys landed in England on January 12th, 1816, and on the 14th
joined the depot at Canterbury.

The establishment was soon ordered to be reduced to 544 all told.

In June, 1817, they marched from Canterbury to Scotland.

In July, 1818, they went to Ireland.

Returning to England, the Regiment landed at Bristol in May, 1821,
and marched to Birmingham and Coventry. In July, it went to London to
attend the coronation of King George IV. In August, the establishment
was further reduced to 6 troops.

In the summer of 1822 the Regiment marched to Scotland.

On August 15th, George IV. landed at Leith, where he was received by
the Regiment, and the Regiment had the honour of attending upon him
during his stay in Scotland. In July, 1823, the Regiment left Scotland,
and was at first stationed at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Carlisle. In the
summer of 1824, it was at Manchester and Nottingham; in May, 1825, at
Coventry, Birmingham, and Northampton. In June, it was quartered near
London--at Hammersmith and Turnham Green. On June 28th, the Greys,
together with other cavalry and a brigade of Horse Artillery, were
reviewed on Hounslow Heath by the Duke of York. The Greys now marched
to Norwich and Ipswich. Early in 1826 they went to Ireland. In May,
1830, they embarked at Cork for Bristol, and marched into quarters at
Dorchester, Weymouth, and Trowbridge; from whence they proceeded, in
November, to Windsor.

On November 9th, Queen Adelaide inspected two squadrons in the
riding-house at Pimlico. Before the end of November, the Regiment
marched to Maidstone.

In 1831, they were at Brighton, Chichester, and Warley. In 1832, in
Birmingham. In 1833, in York. In 1834, they marched to Edinburgh.
In 1835, they were quartered at Leeds. In May, 1836, they embarked
at Liverpool for Ireland. The rest of the movements of the Regiment
are, roughly: Brighton, 1841, Exeter, 1842 and 1843; Ipswich, 1844;
Edinburgh, 1845; Dundalk, 1846; Clonmel, 1847; Athlone, 1848 and 1849;
Longford, 1850; Canterbury, 1851; Dorchester, 1852; Birmingham, 1853;
Nottingham, 1854.

Now next, in regard to the Crimea, it would be absurd to try to adjust
or supplement the following records. They are of unique interest. The
Greys reached the Crimea on September 24th, 1854.

A folio volume, the property of the Regiment, lettered--

  "Historic Register, 2nd Dragoons," and inside, "from August 10th,
  1854":--

  "The average strength of the regiment during the period they have
  been in Turkey and the Crimea has been 223. They arrived in Turkey
  on August 10th, 1855, disembarking at Kulalie on the Adriatic side
  of the Bosphorus. Kulalie is about seven miles north of Scutari.
  There I joined the regiment from Varna on August 31st, having been
  transferred from the medical charge of the 93rd Highlanders to that
  of the Scots Greys on September 22nd.

  "The corps embarked on board the _Himalaya_ for the Crimea, and
  disembarked at the Katchu on September 24th, joining the allied
  army at the time it was executing its flank march on Balaclava.
  That night they bivouacked on the Belbee, and the following day
  came into collision with the enemy at the affair of Mackenzie's
  Farm, when they succeeded in capturing a quantity of baggage,
  ammunition, stores, &c.; also in capturing and destroying a
  portion of the rear guard of Prince Menchikoff's army, and without
  suffering the loss of a man on their part. The following day
  they were present at the capture of Balaclava, and bivouacked on
  the plains in front of that village. On October 25th they took
  a prominent part in the action in front of Balaclava, when the
  Russian army attempted to force that position, and they defeated
  and utterly routed a large body of the enemy's cavalry which had
  attacked and surrounded them in the proportion of three to one.
  After this 'feat of arms' they were led into the cross fires of the
  enemy's batteries, being ordered up to the support of the Light
  Cavalry Brigade their memorable but disastrous charge. On this
  occasion they sustained some severe injury, the wounds inflicted
  being nearly all of a serious nature caused by round shot, shell,
  grape and rifle balls.

  "The loss of the regiment in this action amounted to 2 men killed
  and 54 wounded, several of whom subsequently died of their wounds,
  and 4 officers wounded. The three first men who fell were mortally
  wounded by rifle balls in covering the retreat of the Turks from
  the redoubts....

(_Reduced_)]

  "Nothing of importance occurred from this period up to November
  5th, when the sanguinary battle of Inkerman took place.

  "The Greys were drawn up on the heights in reserve, and did not
  come into collision with the enemy.

  "The regiment remained on the heights before Sebastopol till the
  beginning of December, when owing to the inclemency of the weather,
  having sustained considerable losses both in men and horses, they
  were ordered down to the sheltered valley close to the village of
  Kadekai, where they passed the winter.

                                                  "+T. R. Brush, M.D.+"


I now put on record the following exceedingly pertinent passages from
Kinglake's "Invasion of the Crimea," Vol. V., p. 98, &c., 6th edition,
1877:--

  "All this while, the string of the 300 red coats were forming
  Scarlett's slender first line in the valley beneath, and they
  seemed to be playing parade. At the moment I speak of, the troop
  officers of the Greys were still facing their men; and their drill
  rules, it seems, had declared that they must continue to do so till
  the major of the regiment should at length bring them round by
  giving the order, Eyes right! Not yet would the Greys consent to be
  disturbed in their ceremonies by the descending column.

       *       *       *       *       *

  "A singular friendship had long subsisted between the Scots Greys
  and the Inniskilling Dragoons. It dated from the time of that
  famous brigade in which three cavalry regiments were so brought
  together as to express by their aggregate title the union of
  the three kingdoms, yet offer a sample of each (the 'Royals'
  represented England)....

  "The friendship between the Scottish and the Irish regiment had
  the ardour of personal friendship, and a tenacity not liable to be
  relaxed by mere death; for a regiment great in history bears so far
  a resemblance to the immortal gods as to be old in power and glory,
  yet have always the freshness of youth. Long intervals of years
  often passed in which the Greys and the Inniskillings remained
  parted by distance, but whenever it became known that by some new
  change of quarters the two regiments would once more be brought
  together there used to be great joy and preparation.... When last
  the sworn friends were together in what they might deign to call
  fighting they were under the field glass of the great Napoleon.

  "Then, as now, the Greys charged in the first line, and on the left
  of the Inniskillings.

  "Of the two comrade regiments each had its distinguishing
  characteristics. The Inniskillings, with still some remaining
  traces in their corps of the old warlike Orange enthusiasm, were
  eager, fiery, impetuous. The Scots Greys, with a great power of
  self-restraint, were yet liable to be wrought upon by their native
  inborn desire for a fight till it raged like a consuming passion.

  "From the exceeding tenacity of their nature, it resulted that
  the combative impulses, when long baffled by circumstances, were
  cumulative in their effect; and the events of that day--the capture
  of British guns under the eyes of our horsemen--the marching, the
  counter-marching, the marching again, without ever striking a blow,
  and finally, the dainty dressing of ranks under the eyes of the
  enemy's host--all these antecedent trials of patience had been
  heating and still heating the furnace by the very barriers which
  kept down the flame....

  "The Greys were led by Colonel Darby Griffith; and the two
  squadron leaders who followed him were Major Clarke on the right,
  and Captain Williams on the left. Handley, Hunter, Buchanan,
  and Sutherland were the four troop leaders of the regiment; the
  Adjutant was Lieutenant Miller; the serre-files were Boyd, Nugent,
  and Lenox Prendergast. And to these, though he did not then hold
  the Queen's Commission, I add the name of John Wilson, now a
  cornet, and the acting adjutant of the regiment, for he took a
  signal part in the fight."

The _Illustrated London News_ of November 25th, 1854, has two large
illustrations, one a full page, called "The Action at Balaclava:
Charge of the Scots Greys, October 25th," and the other a double page
illustration, "The Battle of Balaclava: Attack of the Scots Greys." The
reference is to the following:--

                   "+The Attack of the Scots Greys.+

  "A soldier who was in the midst of the terrible conflict at
  Balaclava, and who escaped unhurt, gives the following account of
  what he felt and saw in that deadly struggle:--

  "'We charged. Oh, God! I cannot describe it; they were so superior
  in numbers; they "out-flanked" us, and we were in the middle of
  them. I never certainly felt less fear in my life than I did at
  that time; and I hope God will forgive me, for I felt more like a
  devil than a man. We fought our way out of them as only Englishmen
  can fight; and the 4th, 5th, and 6th were there up with us. I
  escaped without a scratch, thank God, though I was covered with
  blood; my horse was not even wounded. But oh! the work of slaughter
  that then began--'twas truly awful; but I suppose it was necessary.
  We cut them down like sheep, and they did not seem to have power to
  resist. The plain is covered and covered with dead Russians, and,
  of course, we left some of our poor comrades on the field. We only
  lost two and about seven wounded. Well, when we had finished this
  lot we thought of going home to breakfast; but no, they (the enemy)
  had some guns over the hills that Lord Raglan sent word were to
  be charged, and captured at any cost. So off we went again. They
  received us very quietly into their ground--Lord Lucan leading the
  Heavies, and Lord Cardigan the Light Brigade. The Light charged
  first this time, took the guns, cut down the gunners, and then,
  when they thought all was right, they were met by thousands of
  Cossacks, who had been in ambush. The Royals, the Greys, the 4th,
  5th, and 6th, now charged again. The butchering was repeated;
  when suddenly a cross front and rear fire opened upon us from the
  hills--cannon, rifles, and file firing.

Who died in the Crimea 1854, and was buried at Scutari.]

  "'I cannot attempt to describe to you the scene that ensued--balls,
  shells, and rockets whizzing about our ears. The men on the right
  and left of me were both killed on the spot. We hacked our way out
  of it as well as we could, but were obliged to leave the guns.
  Colonel Yorke had his leg broken, and all the officers in the front
  rank were wounded. The Heavy Brigade have not lost many men; but,
  sad to tell, out of about 600 of the Light Brigade that went into
  the field, only 400 came out; but this is nothing to what the enemy
  suffered.'"




CHAPTER VI.


The following is here set up in type direct from the handwriting of a
retired officer of the Greys, giving his own Crimean recollections. He
is modest of his name appearing; and at first intended that I should
write my own account, after listening to his remarks; but I am glad to
say that I induced him to make his own record, and I have even ignored
his request that I would "edit" his writing.

  "War in Europe had ceased for 40 years, when in the reign of Queen
  Victoria peace was broken, and troops from the United Kingdom were
  being sent out to concentrate eventually in Turkey at the call of
  that Power in its resistance to Russian aggression.

  "The Greys were not included at first when the expedition started,
  though cavalry (Heavy and Light) supplied regiments for the force
  concentrated at Varna under Lord Raglan the commander-in-chief of
  the British Army allied to the French in the joint expedition.

  "The Greys were naturally disappointed at receiving no order to
  embark at first, but when it was decided by the Government that an
  invasion of the Crimea was to be undertaken in July, 1854, they
  received orders to start at once for Constantinople, where they
  were quartered in the cavalry barracks at Kulalie on the Bosphorus
  for several weeks during the time the flotilla was in preparation
  for crossing the Black Sea.

  "At last word came that it had embarked for the Crimea, and with it
  as far as cavalry was concerned only light cavalry regiments were
  included at that time.

  "Very shortly, however, the transport _Himalaya_, which had
  originally brought out the regiment from England, appeared in the
  Bosphorus; and immediately embarked the Regáµ for service in the
  Crimea.

  "It so happened that as the _Himalaya_ was passing the Fortress of
  Sebastopol the Russians were engaged in sinking ships to block the
  harbour to our fleet; a momentous decision! as it proved.

  "A remarkable scene then presented itself. First came the British
  Fleet, then the French Fleet, covering the flank of the allied
  army in full march towards the fortress--the French regiments
  being nearest to the sea were sighted first, then the British more
  inland, the whole army (though the fact was yet unknown) flushed
  with victory of the Alma River which they left that morning behind.

  "The Greys in fact joined the army at the Alma River where they
  were met by Lord Burghersh, Lord Raglan's Aide-de-Camp, who gave
  the first intimation of the Battle and suggested the steamer should
  drop down to the next river, the Katcha, and there disembark at any
  rate a squadron if possible before dark, so that it might watch for
  a force expected from Eupatoria to attack the rear of the army.

  "This was done and the bulk of the Regáµ disembarked the following
  morning.

  "At the next river, the Belbec, the Greys from being with the
  rearguard was moved right through the English and French armies,
  bivouacked near the great high road to Sebastopol so as to become
  the advanced guard of the whole army, for they were the freshest
  troops just arrived from England, and 'turned out' as if for a
  Horse Guards Parade!

  "It was a strange scene; as soon as the French caught sight of the
  bearskin caps they began to cheer lustily, and as the Regáµ neared
  the Highlanders of the British army, hung on cheering and asking
  for news from home; the French meanwhile calling out 'Voila de la
  Cavalrie, voila des Grenadiers a cheval.'

  "What followed is worth mentioning in some little detail, since the
  Greys was the only Heavy Cavalry Regáµ as yet landed in the Crimea,
  and a special job fell to their lot that day. The Regáµ being the
  advanced guard of the Allied Forces moving straight to the North
  side of the fortress a singular and most important change of
  direction had to be made quite suddenly when the Russian outposts
  had been reached.

  "This movement is known as 'the flank march,' undertaken in
  consequence of the allied commanders' acceptance of a memorandum by
  Sir John Burgoyne, the distinguished officer of Engineers, pointing
  out that the South side of the fortress was practically undefended,
  and that if the Allied Forces could successfully move round, the
  North side might be left to itself.

  "Sir John Burgoyne's memorandum, dated the day after the battle
  of the Alma, is given in full in an instructive volume by Sir
  John Adye, entitled 'A Review of the Crimean War, published by
  Hurst & Blackett, 1860.' On arrival at the Belbec river the allied
  commanders adopted the plan proposed in the able memorandum alluded
  to.

  "In order to strike the main road which leads into the interior
  of the country down the Mackenzie heights towards Sebastopol
  and to the plains of Balaclava, the allies who, on the morning
  of the 25 September, were on the heights above the Belbec, had
  for some distance to march in a south-easterly direction through
  thick woods, in which there was only a slight track. On the same
  morning Prince Menschikoff, ignorant of the change, and doubtless
  conceiving that the plans of the allied generals were fully
  decided upon the attack on the _North_ side, was moving a force, a
  considerable force, by the same main road up the Mackenzie heights
  and into the country towards Bacskiverai, with the intention,
  probably, when his troops had somewhat regained their confidence,
  and when they had been joined by reinforcements, to return and
  attack the Anglo-French army in its rear.

  "Thus, on the 25th September the two hostile forces were
  unconsciously moving in two lines which intersected each other at
  a point close to the crest of the heights. Consequently, to the
  surprise of both, the advanced guard of the one suddenly found
  itself in the presence of the rearguard of the other. The Russian
  rearguard after standing for a moment dispersed into the wood,
  taking pot-shots at the Greys, who were forming up on the first
  available open space; as this could not be submitted to it became
  necessary, as there were no infantry present, to dismount a portion
  of the Regáµ to skirmish in the wood against the irritating Russian
  Infantry, who, after firing at the horsemen, threw themselves down
  and pretended to be dead.

  "Sir Edward B. Hamley, writing in 1855, in his book, 'The Campaign
  in the Crimea, London, Blackwood,' alludes to having been present
  at this incident, saying, 'Some of the Scots Greys dismounting went
  skirmishing through the wood, and about a dozen Russians throwing
  themselves down and pretending to be dead, rose after they were
  past and fired on them, for which discreditable ruse they were, as
  they deserved to be, all put to death.'

  "This was too much for Jock and he proceeded to use his carbine,
  not however before consulting the Sergeant-Major, (so the
  regimental story goes,) in the words 'Sairgent-Major, shall I shoot
  'em?' and the prompt reply came, 'Most unquestionably!'

  "In the meantime an excited Staff Officer came to the Colonel of
  the Regáµ asking for 'six determined men' to gallop down the ravine
  road and upset the foremost Russian carriage so as to secure the
  convoy. Again the story goes that the Colonel promptly replied by
  ordering 'from the right number off six!' and away they went with
  the happiest result--amongst other loot there was Menschikoff's
  carriage in which was stored a lot of champagne which it is
  needless to say was broached without much delay.

  "In the carriage was a Colonel of high rank who evidently had not
  forgotten to use the contents of the Prince's carriage.

  "He was transferred as a prisoner to the Fleet later on--where he
  remained till at Petersburg the authorities consented to release
  Lord Dunkellin who had been taken prisoner and whose exchange was
  conditional on the return of this officer. There are stories extant
  about his subsequent fate.

  "This casual encounter was so far useful for the moment, that
  it must have rather mystified the enemy as to the places of the
  allies, but Lord Raglan feeling the importance of regaining the
  coast, his army being for the time scattered for miles along a
  thin line, at once retraced his steps and continued his march by
  the steep road down the Mackenzie heights: and towards sunset
  the light and first divisions streamed across the plain followed
  shortly after by the 2nd Division, and subsequently by the French
  Army bearing with them in a litter Marshall St. Arnaud in a dying
  condition. He died, a few days after the town of Balaclava was
  occupied, on board a French Ship of War.

  "Sir John Adye who was present on the occasion describes 'the Flank
  march' as the one great strategic success of the whole War.

  "'The fortunate result of the flank march, by giving the allied
  generals possession of the excellent, though diminutive, harbour of
  Balaclava, and thus affording them a safe communication with their
  fleets, relieved them of one of the anxieties hitherto attending
  their movements, and enabled them to devote all their attention to
  the one great object of the expedition--the capture of Sebastopol.'

  "Considering the immense importance of this little harbour, the
  only depot of the English Army and considering its isolated
  position, it being several miles from the plateau on which the
  infantry of the army was encamped its defence was a cause of keen
  anxiety.

  "It can scarcely be supposed that a few Turkish redoubts with the
  93rd Highlanders under Sir Colin Campbell was a suitable defence
  for such a place--and yet what was there besides the Cavalry
  encamped in the plain?

  "The Cavalry it is true had been reinforced by the arrival of the
  heavy Cavalry RegtË¢ (since the flank march described above) which
  had been left at Varna on the other side of the Black Sea: and
  their performance on the occasion of the coming battle is perhaps
  as well known as any incident during the Crimean War. But the
  battle was not merely a dash and a ride, and to understand what
  took place requires some sifting of the circumstances so as to
  arrive at a definite notion of the _day's work_.

  "After the middle of October the first reinforcements for Prince
  Menschikoff's army having arrived the enemy had been observed for
  some days hovering in the neighbourhood of Balaclava and the troops
  there were constantly kept on the alert.

  "At day break on the 25th October General Liprandi with 20,000
  infantry, supported by a strong force of cavalry and about 40
  guns made a determined attack and in the words of Sir E. Hamley
  the battle commenced by 'the Russian guns on the eminences and in
  the valley opened a cannonade on the outposts held by the Turks.
  A troop of Horse Artillery and a field battery supported by the
  Scots Greys were ordered up to Balaclava to the slopes between
  the outposts and found themselves opposed to the fire of several
  field batteries and service guns of position which covered an
  advance of infantry against the hills on the right. As the troop
  was armed with only 6-pounders, it and the field battery were
  quite over-matched, both in metal and in numbers; nevertheless our
  artillery maintained the contest till its ammunition was exhausted,
  when it retired, having lost a good many horses and a few men
  besides Maude the Captain of the troop, who was severely wounded by
  a shell which burst in his horse.'

  "Time had still to be given to the infantry to arrive from the
  plateau miles away, therefore the squadrons had to be withdrawn
  very _gradually_, all the time being under the fire of Liprandi's
  guns.

  "Thus opened the Battle of Balaklava, the engagement continued
  through the day with separate incidents, with intervals between
  them, and marked by singular interest. Sir Edward Hamley, after
  speaking with measured words of one of these incidents which
  immediately preceded the well-known cavalry charge of the Heavy
  Brigade, says, 'There was something almost theatrical in the
  grandeur of this portion of the spectacle; the French stationed on
  the heights, and the English passing along them, looked down, as if
  from the benches of an amphitheatre, on the two bodies of cavalry
  meeting in mortal shock on the level grassy plain, which enclosed
  on every side by lofty mountains would have been a fit arena for a
  tournament of giants.'"

and 1859, Dublin; 1860, Newbridge; 1861, Dublin; 1862 and 1863,

 _Lord Rosebery, at the unveiling of the Memorial, spoke as follows_:--

  +Colonel Coventry Williams, and Gentlemen of the Scots Greys+,

  You have done me a great honour in asking me to unveil this
  memorial, and, if I may say so, you have done a wise thing in
  erecting it. You have raised to the memory of your comrades a
  memorial in the Capital of Scotland, under the shadow of Edinburgh
  Castle, in the noblest street in the world. But, as things are,
  it must be a memorial not merely to the dead, to those who have
  fallen, but to that proud and illustrious regiment which you
  represent, and which, in the inscrutable dispensation of the higher
  powers, we are so soon to lose for ever from our midst. For the
  Scots Greys are bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. They were
  raised, indeed, in these Lowlands of ours under circumstances which
  do not so much elicit our sympathy as the events of their later
  history, though they were raised by a Lothian man, Colonel Dalziel
  of Binns; as they were raised for the purpose of harrying the
  Covenanters, who represented the backbone of the character and the
  history of Scotland in the reign of the last two Stuarts. However,
  they were soon to be called to higher duties than those of civil
  war. They served gloriously under Marlborough in the Low Countries;
  they fought all through the wars of the eighteenth century; they
  captured a standard at Dettingen; and yet the time of their full
  glory had not come. It was at Waterloo that their chance came;
  it was in that tremendous charge when, with the Inniskillings
  and the Royals, they rode down masses of French infantry--in
  that tremendous charge where Sergeant-Major Ewart, one of your
  non-commissioned officers, wrested an eagle from the French, and
  cut down successively three gallant Frenchmen who stood to defend
  it. Later on that day they came to the assistance of a small body
  of the 92nd Highlanders, and they together, to the cry of "Scotland
  for Ever," annihilated a greatly superior column of the enemy which
  was opposed to them. And, again, as the shades of evening drew on,
  they joined in the unrelenting pursuit of the broken enemy until
  darkness put an end to the engagement. Surely no regiment ever had
  a prouder day than that. It need not be fiction, but may well be
  believed, that Napoleon himself recognised their achievement, and
  honoured their heroic courage. It is not, then, in vain, that to
  this day, and for all time to come, the Scots Greys bear with them
  the symbol of the Eagle and the name of Waterloo.

  Then they were called to serve in the Crimea. We speak in the
  presence of a distinguished Russian officer; but the brave honour
  the brave, and he will allow me to recall, even in his presence,
  that charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaclava, partially forgotten
  in the more startling achievement of the Light Brigade, but still
  splendid and memorable, when the Heavy Brigade, headed once more
  by the Scots Greys and the Inniskillings, rode through the dense
  masses of the enemy. It was at the close of that day that Sir Colin
  Campbell, afterwards Lord Clyde, rode up to the regiment and with
  bared head said to them: "Scots Greys, I am sixty-one, but were
  I a young man I would ask for nothing better than the honour of
  serving in your ranks." Then came the South African War. That was a
  very different campaign. It was war carried on in vast solitudes,
  against small bodies of men--against an enemy that was almost
  always invisible. No such heart-breaking or harassing work for a
  soldier can be conceived. It afforded no room for the splendid
  achievements of Waterloo and the Crimea. It required perseverance,
  patience, and vigilance, almost as much as courage; but is not cold
  courage--cold-blooded courage prolonged through long years--at
  least as meritorious as the hot, warm-blooded courage of the onset?
  The British Army in South Africa fought under harassing conditions.
  They fought a new warfare; they fought hardship and disease; and
  they fought under the discouragement of military operations carried
  on with patience through long years to a tardy but triumphant
  result.

  Gentlemen, I was with the Scots Greys at their last dinner in this
  city; it was a cheerful dinner, but it was not glad or triumphant.
  We met under the shadow of a humiliating reverse; we knew that,
  humanly speaking, we could not expect that all who were then
  present would return to us again. We knew at any rate that all were
  about to face the unknown, and we then resolved and declared that
  evening that having put our hands to this thing we would see it
  through; that we would muddle through somehow, and somehow or other
  we did muddle through. Some of those who were there that night did
  not return, and it is to their memory that we erect this memorial
  to-day.

  Honour to the unreturning brave, the brave who will return no
  more. We shall not see their faces again. In the service of their
  Sovereign and their country they have undergone the sharpness of
  death, and sleep their eternal sleep thousands of miles away in
  the green solitudes of South Africa. Their places, their comrades,
  their saddles will know them no more, for they will never return
  to us as we knew them. But in a nobler and a higher sense, have
  they not returned to us to-day? They return to us with a message of
  duty, of courage, of patriotism. They return to us with a memory
  of high duty faithfully performed. They return to us with the
  inspiration of their example. Peace, then, to their dust. Honour to
  their memory. Scotland for ever!

     [_A copy of the speech was presented to every Trooper of the
             Regiment, with Lord Rosebery's best wishes._]

            gracious message, the Lieutenant-General desires to
            convey to commanding officers, officers, N.C.O.'s and
            men, his warmest thanks for the support and assistance
            he has received from them, and to express his profound
            admiration for the skill and courage so abundantly
            displayed at every critical phase of the operations, and
            for the cheerfulness with which they have endured much
            privation and hardship. To this alone he attributes the

  _Mar. 7th._--The regiment marched from Osfontein; enemy located
            about 9.30 a.m. They immediately evacuated their
            position, and as the horses were too weak to pursue

            Bloemfontein. After firing a few shots, the enemy
            retired, and the city surrendered to Lord Roberts about
            10.30 a.m.

            Bivouacked west of Bloemfontein.

  _14th._--Army Orders: "It affords the F.-M. Commanding-in-Chief the
            greatest pleasure in congratulating the Army in South
            Africa on the events which have occurred during the past
            few weeks, and he would especially offer his sincerest
            thanks to that portion of the Army under his immediate
            command which have taken part in the operations,
            resulting yesterday in the capture of Bloemfontein. On
            February 12th this force crossed the boundary which
            divided the Orange Free State from British territory.
            Three days later Kimberley was relieved. On the fifteenth
            day the bulk of the Boer army in the State, under one of
            their most trusted generals, was made prisoners.

            "On the seventeenth day the news of the relief of
            Ladysmith was received, and on March 13th, 29 days from
            the commencement of the operations, the capital of the
            Orange Free State was occupied. This is a record of which
            any army may well be proud--a record which could not have
            been achieved except by earnest, well-disciplined men,
            determined to do their duty, and to surmount whatever
            difficulties or dangers might be encountered. Exposed
            to extreme heat by day, bivouacking under heavy rain,
            marching long distances, not infrequently with reduced
            rations, the endurance, cheerfulness, and gallantry
            displayed by all ranks are beyond praise; and Lord
            Roberts feels sure that neither H.M. the Queen nor the
            British nation will be unmindful of the efforts made by
            the Force to uphold the honour of their country.

            "The Field-Marshal desires especially to refer to the
            fortitude and heroic spirit with which the wounded have
            borne their sufferings.

            "Owing to the great extent of country over which modern
            battles have to be fought, it is not always possible
            to afford immediate relief to those who are struck
            down. Many hours have indeed elapsed before some of the
            wounded could be attended to, but not a word or murmur
            of complaint has been uttered. The anxiety of all when
            succour came was that their comrades should be cared for
            first. In assuring every officer and man how much he
            appreciates their efforts in the past, Lord Roberts is
            confident that in the future they will continue to show
            the same resolution and soldierly qualities, and to lay
            down their lives if need be (as so many brave men have
            already done) in order to assure that the war in South
            Africa may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion."

  _Mar. 15th, 16th, and 17th._--At Bloemfontein.

  _18th._--The regiment marched from Bloemfontein at 7.50 a.m. to

            of General Broadwood's column, which had been ambushed

UNIFORM AND ARMS.

In February, 1683, General Dalzell, "finding that he cannot be provided
in this kingdom with as much cloth of one colour as will be clothes to
the regiment of dragoons," obtained from the Privy Council of Scotland
a licence permitting the cloth manufacturing company at Newmills "to
import 2,536 ells of stone-grey cloth from England, for clothing the
said regiment of dragoons."

The men wore iron helmets and very high boots.

Each trooper seems to have been armed with a matchlock musket and a
bayonet, and wore a collar of bandoliers. There were, however, twelve
men in each troop not thus armed, but carrying halberds and pistols.
These same twelve probably also carried hand grenades.

By an order dated February 21st, 1687, Dragoons were ordered to have
"snaphanse musquets, strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouche boxes, bayonets, granado pouches, bucketts, and
hammer-hatchetts."

The following is from a contemporary MS. belonging to the Regiment:--

  "Major Agnew's Troop is D. for Camp Accoutrements in the year 1704.

  To 133  ells of Linning for 38 Dragoon shirts.
      45  ditto for necks.
      48Â½ ells musline.
       8      "   sylks.
       8  hatchets.
      48  suit of furrage & caps.
     210  ells whyte and bleu lining for Dragoon frocks.
      48  cocades.
      48  shoe buckels."

  'Dieu et mon Droit,' underneath; the white horse in a compartment
  in the first and fourth corners, and II. D. in gold characters on

  third guidons to be of blue silk; in the centre the thistle within
  the circle of St. Andrew, and motto, 'Nemo me impune lacessit';
  the white horse on a scarlet ground in the first and fourth
  compartments; and II. D., on a red ground, within a small wreath of

[Illustration: +General Dalzell's Comb.+]

In the volume belonging to the Regiment, and dated 1759, are the
following entries relating to dress:--

  "_22 January._--A stiver to be stopped from each man for
            having his hatt cocked, which the Major hopes the
            regiment won't be against paying, as it is for their own
            advantage.

  "_25 January._--The troops to send the bread waggons for their
            hatts and gloves on Monday next, and no man to presume to
            alter the cock, otherwise it will be done over again, and
            he be obliged to pay every time it is not in shape."

In 1764 further changes were made. The Regiment was ordered to be
remounted with long-tailed horses! The officers and men were directed
to wear epaulettes on the left shoulder instead of aiguillettes. The
colour of the waistcoats and breeches was changed from blue to white,
and the button-holes were ordered to be plain. At the same time, jacked
leather boots were replaced by others of a lighter description, and the
silver binding on the officers' coats was discontinued.

On December 19th, 1768, appeared another royal warrant ordering the
Regiment to wear black bearskin caps, with the thistle within the
circle of St. Andrew, and the motto, "Nemo me impune lacessit," on the
front of the cap.

In 1788, an order was issued for sword-belts to be worn suspended
across the right shoulder, instead of being fastened round the waist;
also to wear an epaulette, or strap, on the right shoulder uniform with
that on the left.

In 1808, an order was issued for the men's hair to be cut short,
instead of being plaited and tied up and powdered. In 1811, an order
was made for the men's coats to be made in future shorter in the
skirts, and broad yellow lace, down the front and round the skirts and
cuffs, was introduced in the place of the narrow white lace hitherto
worn across the breast, arms, and skirts. Also plush breeches were to
be worn instead of leather.

In the summer of 1812, web breeches and grey cloth overalls were
introduced, and a valice (_sic_) of scarlet cloth was substituted for
the leather saddle bags. The battle of Waterloo, so famous in the
Regiment's history, is commemorated by the badge of an eagle displayed
on the guidons, and the word "Waterloo" borne on the guidons and on the
grenadier caps.

In the Official Regulations for Officers' Dress, dated 1846, page 109:--

  "The Second or Royal North British Dragoons have permission to wear
  a bear-skin cap with a white hackle feather, nine inches long,
  according to regimental pattern."

In the Official Regulations of 1864 for Officers, at p. 57:--

  "Head dress for the 2nd Dragoons, a bear-skin cap, with a gilt
  thistle on the front, and on the left side a gilt grenade to
  receive the plume bearing the Royal arms, above the badge of St.
  Andrew, and the word 'Waterloo' below.

  "Plume, a white hackle feather, nine inches long."

At page 42 of the Officers' Dress Regulations, dated 1894, is:

  "Cap for 2nd Dragoons (Scots Greys) black bearskin, 10 inches high;
  with a gilt thistle in front; and a gilt grenade on the left side,
  as a plume socket, bearing the badge of St. Andrew, with the Royal
  arms above, and the word 'Waterloo' below. Plain gilt burnished
  chain, lined with black leather.

  "Plume--white hackle feather, 9 inches long."

                   LIST OF OFFICERS PAST AND PRESENT.

ALEXANDER ABERCROMBY.

  Cornet, 16 August, 1799. Promoted Lieutenant, in 52nd Foot, 19
  March, 1800.

SIR RALPH ABERCROMBY.

  Colonel, 2 November, 1796. Died on or before 16 May, 1801.

  The General who shares with Sir John Moore, the credit of renewing
  the ancient discipline and military reputation of the British
  soldier, was born at Menstry near Tullibody, in October, 1734.
  Educated at Rugby, and afterwards studied law at Edinburgh and
  Leipzig. In 1756 made a Cornet in 3rd Dragoon Guards. In 1758 he
  went with his regiment to Germany, where it formed part of the
  English force under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, the victor
  of Minden. Lieutenant, 1760. Captain, 1762. In 1767 he married
  Miss Menzies, with whom he lived very happily. Major, 1770.
  Lieutenant-Colonel, 1773. Became M.P. for county of Clackmannan,
  but soon gave up Parliamentary life. War broke out with France, he
  was made a Major-General, and ordered to Flanders with a Brigade.
  First made his mark at Furnes, commanded the storming column at the
  siege of Valenciennes, and was publicly thanked by the Duke of York
  for his conduct at Roubaix. Returned to England in 1795, and made a
  Knight of the Bath. In November, 1795, sailed for the West Indies
  with 15,000 men, to reduce the French Sugar Islands. In 1799 he was
  despatched with 10,000 men, to attack Holland. On 20 October in an
  attack on Bergen, he had two horses shot under him.... 24 October,
  1800, he was ordered to proceed with all his troops, to Egypt to
  expel or capture the French Army left there by Napoleon.... 27
  December, he cast anchor in the bay of Marmorice. Here he waited 6
  weeks, receiving some slight reinforcements, and discovering that
  the Turks were quite useless as allies. But while waiting he looked
  after his soldiers' health, and practised disembarkments until the
  whole force thoroughly understood how to promptly disembark, and
  every man knew his place in his boat.... On 2 March he anchored
  in Aboukir Bay.... In the end Menou was beaten back with immense
  loss, including 3 generals killed, while the English loss was only
  1464 killed and wounded. Among the latter was Sir Ralph Abercromby,
  who riding in front in his usual reckless manner, was wounded in
  the thigh by a musket ball. He was carried to the Foudroyant, the
  flagship. "What is it you have placed under my head?" asked the
  wounded general. "Only a soldier's blanket," answered the aide de
  camp. "Only a soldier's blanket; make haste and return it to him at
  once."

  He died on board the flagship on 28 March.

  No biography would be complete which did not notice his extreme
  shortsightedness, almost blindness, nor yet without noticing the
  singular sweetness and purity of his domestic life, which made all
  who came across him, from the Duke of York, whom he eclipsed, to
  Lord Camden, with whom he quarrelled, acknowledge the charm of his
  society.

MICHAEL GOOLD ADAMS.

  Cornet by purchase, 21 July, 1825. Lieutenant by purchase, 30
  July, 1829. Captain by purchase, 28 December, 1838. Exchanged to

  Captain-Lieutenant, 8 February, 1712-13. Captain, 16 September,

  Sir Andrew Agnew, fifth Baronet of Lochnau, twelfth and last of
  the hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway, was born in 1687. He joined
  Marlborough's army as a volunteer immediately after the battle
  of Blenheim.... He fought bravely at Ramillies, Oudenarde, and
  Malplaquet. At the Peace of Utrecht he was reduced as Captain on
  half-pay of the Scots Greys. Soon after he eloped with a kinswoman,
  the daughter of Captain Thomas Agnew, of the same regiment. This
  lady, to whom he was married in London, bore him 18 children.
  She survived her husband, and died at the age of 87. At the time
  of the rebellion of 1715-16, the young laird of Lochnau was on
  full pay in Colonel Pocock's, which was disbanded in Ireland in
  1718, when he was removed to the 21st Royal Scots Fusiliers, with
  which corps he served upwards of a quarter of a century, becoming
  Lieutenant-Colonel in 1740, and commanding it with distinction
  at the battle of Dettingen. He held Brigade commands under the
  Duke of Cumberland in Flanders, at Bruges, Ghent, and Ostend,
  and at the head of his Scots Fusiliers accompanied the army sent
  to Scotland in 1746, when he was detached to Blair Castle, and
  made a gallant stand there. In 1756 he became Major-General, and
  Lieutenant-General in 1759. Sir Walter Scott describes him as a
  soldier of the old school, stiff and formal in manner, brave to the
  last degree, and something of a humourist.

  son, William Blair, of Blair. This gentleman was named by the
  restoration government of Scotland a member of the Commission in
  Ayrshire for holding courts on the Covenanters, but he early joined
  the revolution party.... Having raised a troop of horse in support
  of King William, he marched with it into Perthshire. News of this
  reaching Viscount Dundee, then in arms in Atholl for King James, he
  determined to surprise them, and marching by night towards Perth,
  he entered the city unawares early the next morning, seized the
  laird of Blair and the laird of Pollock who was with him, and two
  other officers, in their beds. He carried them off prisoners to the
  highlands, where the laird of Blair died shortly afterwards. He had

  Hamilton. Their son, William Blair of Blair, was a commissioner of

  in 1689. He married Magdalene, daughter of James Campbell. Their
  son John predeceased him unmarried, and was succeeded by his sister
  Magdalene, who married William Scott, and had a son William, her
  heir. The heiress of Blair is supposed to have died before 1715,

  In this battle the Scots Greys were stationed in front of the

  3rd son of Robert Dundas, a merchant of Edinburgh, was born

  1752 to 1755 he assisted General David Watson, his maternal
  uncle, in the great survey of Scotland. Colonel, 16 May, 1801.
  General, 29 April, 1802. Resigned, 27 January, 1813, on being
  appointed Colonel of the 1st Dragoon Guards. In 1754 he was
  appointed a Lieutenant-Fireworker in the Royal Artillery, and in
  1755 a Practitioner-Engineer. In 1756 he was made a Lieutenant
  in the 56th Regiment, and in the same year was made Assistant
  Quartermaster-General to General Watson. He threw up his staff
  appointment in 1758 to join his regiment, ordered on active
  service, and took part in the attack on St. Malo, the capture of
  Cherbourg, and the fight at St. Cas. At the close of the same
  year he joined the Army under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick,
  in the threefold capacity of Assistant Quartermaster-General,
  Engineer, and Lieutenant of Infantry. After the campaign he left
  Germany, to become a Captain in the 15th Light Dragoons. He was
  in the battles of Corlach, Warburg, and Clostercampen, the siege
  of Wesel, the battle of Fellinghausen, and then, in 1762, in the
  expedition to Cuba. The Seven Years' War over, he became a deep
  student of his profession, and attended every year manÅuvres of
  the French, Prussian, or Austrian armies. In 1770 he was promoted
  Major. In 1775 he purchased the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the 12th
  Light Dragoons. In 1778 Quartermaster-General in Ireland. In 1781
  promoted Colonel. In 1782 made Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Irish
  Horse. In 1788 he published his valuable work "The Principles of
  Military Movements." In 1790 he was promoted Major-General, and
  in 1791 made Colonel of the 22nd Regiment. In June, 1792, were
  issued--Rules and Regulations for the Formation, Field Exercises,
  and Movements of His Majesty's Forces. These were drawn up by
  Dundas, and issued officially. "Rules and Regulations for the
  Cavalry," were also, at once, issued under similar conditions; but,
  in this case, he had been largely aided by the experience of Sir
  James Stewart Denham (also of the Greys). He commanded a brigade of
  Cavalry at Tournay, on 22 May, 1794. Next, he fought the battles of
  Geldermalsen and Tuyl. In 1795 he was made Colonel of the 7th Light
  Dragoons, Quartermaster-General in 1796.... In 1801 he was made
  Colonel of the Greys and Governor of Fort George, in the place of
  Sir Ralph Abercromby. In 1802 promoted General. Commander-in-Chief,
  1809 to 1811. In 1813, Colonel of the 1st Dragoon Guards. Died, 18
  February, 1820.

  Sir Henry Bunbury recorded:--"Dundas was a tall, spare man,
  crabbed and austere, dry in his looks and demeanour. He had made
  his way from a poor condition (he told me himself that he walked
  from Edinburgh to London to enter himself as a fireworker in the
  artillery).... There was much care and valour in that Scotchman."

PATRICK FERGUSON.

  Cornet in the Lieutenant-Colonel's troop, in the Muster signed at
  Kelso, 13 August, 1763. In Muster Roll ending 26 December, 1768,
  promoted to be a Lieutenant in the 70th Regiment. Born in 1744,
  his father being James Ferguson of Pitfours, Aberdeenshire. He
  was taught fortification, gunnery, &c., in a military academy in
  London, and in 1759, before he was 15, was appointed a Cornet
  in the Greys. On 2nd December, 1776, he obtained a patent for
  improvements in Fire-arms. The patent covers several forms of
  breech action, the use of sliding back sights, and also a peculiar
  mode of rifling. After some successful public experiments at
  Woolwich, and before the King at Windsor, the inventor returned
  to his regiment, then quartered at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was
  allowed to form a corps of riflemen with volunteers from regiments
  in America. The men were armed with breech-loading rifled carbines.
  This corps of riflemen, extended in front and supported by a corps
  of rangers, did good service in covering General Knyphausen's
  advance at the Battle of Brandywine, 11 September, 1777, when
  Ferguson received a severe wound. 26 October, 1779, he was made
  Major in the old 71st Highlanders, then in America. In Carolina
  under Lord Cornwallis, he was again wounded severely. At the fight
  of King's Mountain, on 9 October, 1780, he was surprised and
  killed. The D. N. B. concludes: "Ferguson is allowed by all to have
  been a generous, chivalrous soldier, but the partisan warfare in
  which he was engaged gave rise to rancorous feelings on both sides.
  It is alleged that indignities were offered to his mangled corpse
  and great barbarities practised on the wretched militiamen under
  him who were taken prisoners. Unable to show other marks of respect
  to his memory, Ferguson's brother officers published a notice of
  him in the form of a monumental epitaph in the _New York Gazette_,
  14 February, 1781."

  and amidst a shower of bullets coolly examined one of the four
  barriers which had been raised by the insurgents. He then sallied
  into the street at the head of his men, and whilst with one party
  he attacked the barrier, another under his directions seized two
  houses which overlooked the whole town."

JAMES GARDINER.

  24 February, 1707-8, Lieutenant in Captain William Crawford's
  Additional Troop.

  The above entry in the original manuscript "Army List" at the
  Record Office was evidently unknown to the editors of the
  "Dictionary of National Biography," who have been careful to
  explain that the famous Colonel Gardiner killed at Prestonpans had
  not served in the Greys.

  In the same manuscript the Earl of Stair is recorded as Colonel,
  and this same William Crawford as Captain-Lieutenant commanding the
  Colonel's own troop. In the next MS. list, of about 1714, James
  Gardiner appears again.

  The chief points in Gardiner's life must be taken from the Rev.
  Dr. Doddridge's "Some remarkable passages in the Life of the Hon.
  Colonel James Gardiner, who was slain at the battle of Prestonpans,
  September 21, 1745." He was the son of Captain Patrick Gardiner,
  of Torwood Head, Linlithgowshire, and was born 10 January, 1687.
  At the early age of 14 he bore an ensign's commission in a Scotch
  Regiment in the Dutch service until 1702, when he received an
  Ensign's commission from Queen Anne. At the age of 19, in the
  battle of Ramillies, he received a wound in his mouth by a musket
  ball. "He was of a party in the forlorn hope, and was commanded on
  what seemed almost a desperate service, to dispossess the French of
  the churchyard at Ramillies, where a considerable number of them
  were posted to remarkable advantage. He planted his colours on an
  advanced ground, and while he was calling to his men, he received a
  shot into his mouth."

  Mr. Dalton has rightly recorded Gardiner as a Lieutenant in the
  Greys, and adds a note--"Master of the Horse to the Earl of
  Stair when that nobleman was sent Ambassador to France in 1715.
  Appointed Major of the Earl of Stair's Regiment of Dragoons (now
  the Inniskilling Dragoons), 14 January, 1717. Lieutenant-Colonel of
  the same Regiment, 4 January, 1730. Colonel of the Regiment now the
  13th Hussars, 18 April, 1743."

  On the 22nd July, 1715, at the battle of Preston, he headed a
  storming party of 12, and advancing to the barricades of the
  insurgents, set them on fire, in spite of a furious storm of
  musketry, by which 8 of his men were killed.

  I abridge from the "Dictionary of National Biography," and other
  sources, the following note of Colonel Gardiner's last fight:--On
  19 April, 1743, Gardiner became Colonel of the 13th Hussars, then
  quartered in East Lothian, in which district Gardiner had lately
  purchased a residence. On the outbreak, in 1745, Gardiner's and
  Hamilton's Dragoons were retained in the low country, while Cope
  set out to oppose the Pretender in the highlands. 14 August, 1745,
  four troops of Gardiner's Dragoons marched to Perth, but had to
  retreat, chiefly owing to the supineness of Cope and the fame of
  the Pretender's highlanders. On 20 September, 1745, the two armies
  sighted each other at Prestonpans, and the battle was fought the
  following morning. "Gardiner's Dragoons were posted on Cope's
  right wing, and after the discomforture of Whitney's Dragoons were
  ordered to charge the enemy, but after a faint fire only 11 obeyed
  the word of command, the others wheeling round and galloping from
  the field. The battle was irretrievably lost; but Gardiner, who had
  already been wounded by shots in the left breast and right thigh,
  seeing a party of infantry who were bravely fighting near him
  without an officer to head them, rode up to them crying out, 'Fire
  on, my lads, and fear nothing!' but at that moment he was cut down
  by three more wounds--one in his shoulder by a ball, another in his
  fore-arm by a broadsword, and the third was a blow on the head from
  a Lochaber axe. He was carried to the manse of Tranent, and lived
  until the forenoon of the next day."

  Born at Cairness, 8 December, 1788, son of Charles Gordon, of

  College, Oxford, 20 January, 1806. Cornet in the Greys 10 December,
  1807. Lieutenant in March, 1809, and before the close of the year
  exchanged into the 43rd Regiment. In 1810 he quitted the British
  service and started on foreign travel. In 1813 he served as Captain
  on the Staff of the Russian army. In 1816 he was at Constantinople
  and married Barbara Kana, afterwards Baroness de Pedaiges, a lady
  of Armenian Greek extraction. In 1821 the war of Greek independence
  began, and he served as _chef d'Ã©tat_ major under Ipsilanti. He
  took an active part at the siege of Tripoliza, and after the town
  was taken he remonstrated against the treacherous massacre by
  the Greeks of several thousand Turks. His representations being
  disregarded, he quitted the service. At last, after many urgent
  requests that he would join the Greek service again, he, in May,
  1826, returned to promote unity and military discipline. In
  January, 1827, he accepted the command of the expedition to the
  PirÃ¦us with the local rank of Brigadier. His aim was to relieve
  Athens, then blockaded by Kutahi. Gordon successfully landed his
  troops at Port Phalerus "under the nose of Reshid Pasha." On 11
  February the Turks made a determined attack, but were driven
  back with great slaughter. Finding that Athens was still able to
  hold out, he wished to resign, but was induced to continue upon
  condition of receiving supplies and being "entirely master of his
  own operations." He continued until the arrival of General Church
  to take over supreme command as generalissimo. On April 16 Gordon
  was appointed Director-General of the Ordnance Department. On May
  6 the disastrous battle before Athens put an end to all organised
  military operations by the Greeks in the Morea. The battle of
  Navarino soon ended the struggle. In 1832 was published in London
  his "History of the Greek Revolution," a work of great value. On
  the formation of the Greek Kingdom he was appointed Colonel _Ã  la
  suite_ and Colonel on the Staff of the Greek army. On 7 July, 1835,
  he was appointed Major-General. He died at Cairness, 20 April, 1841.

  "I have not received the favour of any letter from you since my
  last. Yesterday we had the satisfaction to see the garrison of
  Menin march out to the number of about 4,300 men, besides the
  sick and wounded, which could not yet be transported for want of
  conveniency. We have put 5 battalions into the place under the
  command of Major-General Welderen; and while the neighbourhood of
  the French army obliges us to continue here to level our works and
  repair the breaches at Menin, we have ordered some cannon, with a
  detachment, to attack Dendermonde. The troops will be all before
  the place to-morrow or Saturday. My brother Churchill is appointed
  to command the siege, and if the dry weather hold, I hope we shall
  in a few days be masters of the town, which will secure the Pays de
  Waes and a good part of Brabant.

  "Yesterday Lord John Hay, Colonel of the royal regiment of Scots
  Dragoons, died of a lingering fever, after about twenty days'
  illness, being generally regretted through the whole army. I fear

SIR THOMAS LIVINGSTON.

  Born in Holland, 1652, was elder of the two sons of Sir Thomas
  Livingstone, who was created a baronet by Charles I., and was
  colonel of a regiment of foot in the Dutch service. His mother
  was the daughter of Colonel Edmond, of Stirling. He succeeded
  his father as second baronet of Newbiggin, and acquired military
  reputation as an officer in the Scots Brigade in the pay of
  Holland. He came to England with William of Orange in 1688 as
  colonel of a regiment of foot, and on 31 Dec., 1688, was appointed
  colonel of the royal regiment of Scots Dragoons, now the Royal
  Scots Greys. Livingston served in Scotland under General Hugh
  Mackay, and when in command at Inverness, by forced marches with
  a body of horse and dragoons, surprised and completely routed
  the Jacobite forces under General Thomas Buchan at Cromdale, on
  1 May, 1690. The engagement put an end to the resistance of the
  clans. Livingston succeeded General Mackay as commander-in-chief in
  Scotland, and was sworn of the Privy Council. On 1 Jan., 1696, he
  became Major-General on the English establishment, and on 4 Dec.,
  1696, was created Viscount of Teviot in the peerage of Scotland, by
  patent to him and his heirs male.

  Livingstone married Macktellina Walrave de Nimmeguen, from whom
  he appears to have separated. She "pursued" him in the Scottish
  courts in November, 1703, for the sum of 500_l._, to pay her debts
  contracted since he left her, and alimony at the rate of 400_l._ a
  year. The lords of session "recommended, under the circumstances
  of the case, to cause pay her bygon debts, and to settle somewhat
  upon the lady yearly with the time coming, and to treat with the
  Viscount to that effect" (see Launder, Sir John, Lord Fountainhall,
  Decisions, ii., 200). As a result probably of this litigation,
  Teviot sold the colonelcy of the Scots Greys on 7 April, 1704,
  to Lord John Hay. In the Great Seal Registers are charters of
  resignation by him of the lands of Lethington, on 23 June, 1702,
  and of the lands of Waughton on 26 July, 1704. Teviot became a
  lieutenant-general on 1 Jan., 1704. He died in London, aged 60,
  on 14 Jan., 1711, when having no heirs male, the viscountcy
  became extinct, and the family baronetcy devolved on his brother,
  Sir Alexander Livingstone, third baronet. Teviot was buried in
  Westminster Abbey, where his brother is said to have erected to
  his memory a sumptuous monument which no longer exists. By his
  will, dated 27 Sept., 1710, he left his house and estate, known as
  Livingston House, Wimbledon, Surrey, with furniture, plate, etc.,
  to Lady Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, second earl
  of Aboyne. The lady, at this time a child, died unmarried in 1770.
  The remainder of his property went to his brother, Sir Alexander,
  except a legacy of 1,000_l._ to his cousin-german, John Cornelius
  Edmond, then residing in Holland.

MURRAY, LORD CHARLES, FIRST EARL OF DUNMORE.

  Second son of John, second Earl and First Marquis of Atholl, by
  Lady Amelia Sophia Stanley, daughter of the seventh Earl of Derby,
  was born in 1660. On the enrolment in 1681 of General Thomas
  Dalyell's regiment of horse, now the Scots Greys, Lord Charles
  Murray was appointed its first lieutenant-colonel. He was also
  master of horse to Princess Anne. After the death of Dalyell he,
  on 6 Nov., 1685, obtained the colonelcy of the regiment, and was
  also about the same time appointed master of the horse to Mary of
  Modena, queen consort of James II. During 1684 he was engaged in
  the campaign in Flanders, and was present at the siege of Luxemburg.

  On 6 Aug., 1686, he was created by James II. Earl of Dunmore,
  Viscount Fincastle, and Lord Murray of Clair, Moulie, and Tillemot;
  at the Revolution he was deprived of all his offices.

  After the accession of Queen Anne, Dunmore was sworn a privy
  councillor 4 Feb., 1703, and in the parliament of 21 May his patent
  was read and ordered to be recorded, whereupon he took his seat.

  In 1704 Dunmore was appointed one of a committee of parliament
  for examining the public accounts, and in September, 1705, his
  services were rewarded by a gratuity. He gave constant support
  to the Union with England. In 1707 he was appointed governor of
  Blackness Castle. He died in 1710. By his wife Catherine, daughter
  of Richard Watts, of Hereford, Dunmore had six sons and three
  daughters:--James, viscount of Fincastle, who died unmarried in
  1706; John, third earl of Dunmore; William, third earl; Robert,
  brigadier-general; Thomas, lieutenant-general; Charles; Henriet,
  married to Patrick, third Lord Kinnaird; Anne, to John, fourth earl
  of Dundonald; and Catherine, to her cousin John, third Lord Nairn.
  The second son, John, second earl of Dunmore, who had a somewhat
  distinguished career as a soldier, and fought at Blenheim as
  ensign, 13 Aug., 1704, and as lieutenant-general under the Earl of
  Stair at Dettingen, in June, 1743; was on 22 June, 1745, appointed
  governor of Plymouth, and raised to the rank of full general.
  William, the third son, who became third earl of Dunmore on the
  death of his brother in 1752, had been concerned in the rebellion
  of 1745, and sent a prisoner to London, but pleading guilty,
  received a pardon.

    1774. Colchester, May 2nd. Gen. Preston. (As above.)

    1777. Worcester, May 10th. Major-Gen. Parker.--"The regiment is
        very fit for service, and though the men are not particularly
        upright, makes a handsome appearance, the men are to be
        supplied with _bearskin caps_ at their next clothing, and the
        officers are to be provided likewise with bearskin caps, it
        was said in excuse for the badness of the horses tails, that
        on account of the colour their tails were frequently plucked,
        and the hairs stolen. The officers mess together and seem to
        live in harmony. The trumpeters when the regiment dismounted
        and formed in battalion, played two of them on clarionettes,
        two French horns and two on bassoons, and there is besides a
        music master paid to instruct them, who was present in the
        field."

            +Note.+--I expect the hairs were stolen for fishing
            purposes, silk-worm gut not yet having come into
            use.--_S. M. Milne._

    1779. Salisbury, October 6th. Gen. Johnston.--Officers' uniform
        "royal facings, gold embroidered button holes, although
        the men have white, and caps with black bearskin fronts,
        handsomely embroidered and ornamented."

            +Note.+--These caps had just superseded the tall cloth
            fronted old established Grenadier caps, fronted with blue
            cloth, displaying the "_White Horse_" and the _Star_ of
            the Order of the Thistle.--_S. M. Milne._

    1781. Blandford, October 6th. By Gen. Warde.

    1782. Durham, September 12th. Lord Adam Gordon.--"Has _three_
        standards one good and two bad. I do not recollect, in the
        thirty five years I have known the regiment, ever to have
        seen it finer; if the horse furniture was scarlet, instead of
        blue, it would shew better, in my humble opinion."

    1783. Musselburgh, May 27th. Gen. Mackay.

    1784. Manchester, June 3rd. Gen. Johnstone.--"New standards given
        out in 1783. Royal facings with gold embroidered button
        holes, two epaulettes, as grenadiers have, and black bearskin
        caps."

            +Note.+--At this period _all_ other heavy cavalry
            officers had only one epaulette!--_S. M. Milne._

    1792. Manchester, June 7th. Gen. Hyde.

    1801. Dorchester, September 28th. Gen. Garth.--"_Five_ standards
        in good order."

            +Note.+--The regiment had been increased to eight, or
            perhaps ten, troops.--_S. M. Milne._

    1802. Croydon, October 11th. Major-Gen. Cartwright.--Reviewed
        by "His Majesty" on Ashford Common, _September 24th, 1801_.
        "White stable jackets are made with the regiment, and paid
        for by the men, price 11/-. In marching order the men wear
        their fur caps--the horse cloth is placed on the saddle,
        cloak before water deck over the saddle bags, and collar
        chain in the horse shoe case,--in watering order the men
        wear Russia duck trousers, and make use of the bridoon as a
        bridle--reason assigned for placing the 'chain' in the horse
        shoe case is that when worn on the neck it stains the colour
        (grey) of the horse--no overalls are in use in the regiment,
        four standards are in use."

    1803. Croydon, May 25th. Gen. Gwynn.

  "The medal struck by Napoleon to commemorate the invasion of
  England, which has come into the sale-room again, would have
  fetched a far higher price when it was first cast could his
  contemporaries have had guarantee of the falseness of the prophecy
  which it expresses. Those were the days when the Volunteer movement
  was born; those the days when Pitt promised an importunate squad
  that they should not be sent out of the country--except in case of
  actual invasion. At about this time a notable prayer was published.
  It begins by invoking a blessing upon 'a' in this house, and a'
  within two miles ilka side this house, the cow, the kail-yard, and
  the muckle town o' Dumbarton.' The Scots Greys lying in Hamilton
  Barracks are commended to favour. 'They are braw chiels--they are
  not like the English whalps, that dash their foot against a stone,
  and damn the soul of the stone, as if a stone had a soul to be

Royal Scots Dragoons, 1696 to 1704-6." The first writing in the book
(it is really a guard book for insertions) is--

The two following letters from General Dalyell do not relate to the
Greys, but are charming specimens of written language. It may be well
to remember that the great Duke of Marlborough was almost devoid of
education.

In the Record Office under the date 30th October, 1684, is the
following order, which is of particular interest as incidentally
illustrating that the Dragoon was neither Cavalry nor Infantry, but the
chosen hero of modern story--the Mounted Infantryman.

    For the preventing of all disputes that might arise concerning
        the Rank of our Royall Regiment of Dragoons or of any other
        Regiment of Dragoons that shall be employed in our Service;
        Wee have thought fit hereby to declare Our Pleasure--

  That our own Royall Regiment of Dragoons, and all other Regiments
  of Dragoons to be employed in our Service shall have precedency
  both as horse and Foot as well in Guarrison an in the Field as
  in all Counsells of Warr and other Military occasions; and the
  Colonells and Officers of the said Regiments of Dragoons shall
  command as Officers of Horse and Foot according to the nature
  of the place where they shall be (that is to say) that in the
  Field the said Regiments shall take place as Regiments of Horse,
  according to the date of their commissions; and that in Guarison
  they command as Foot Officers, and their Regiments take place
  amongst the Foot according to their respective seniorities from the
  time they were raised.

The following, by kind permission of the Editor of the _Globe_, and
the author, Colonel R. M. Holden, F.S.A.Scot., is reprinted from the
_Globe_ of 14th June, 1906:--

                           THE WATERLOO BALL

  The Congress of Vienna was about to break up, not in the best
  possible humour, when the announcement fell like a thunderbolt that
  Napoleon had escaped from Elba, which had been assigned to him on
  his abdication in 1814, that he had landed in France, had entered
  Paris, and had re-ascended the throne. The Allied Sovereigns
  soon silenced their differences in a harmonious resolution to
  combine against the disturber of the peace. Napoleon was declared
  the common enemy of Europe, his sovereignty was ignored, and
  preparations for war at once entered upon. It is estimated that by
  June a million of men were ready to fall upon France.

  The Duke of Wellington established his headquarters at Brussels,
  where he had with him in and about the city over 25,000 men. The
  city was filled with fashionable non-combatants of all nations,
  including numbers of British who had long been cut off from the
  Continent, and had been drawn thither by curiosity, or from having
  relations in the army. The whole place teemed with intrigue, for
  there were still a large number of officials who had served under
  Napoleon, and were ready to return to him. However, everything
  outwardly remained quiet, and there was no sense of immediate
  danger. Parties were common, "and all went merry as a marriage
  bell." Among the social entertainments none was so much talked
  about as the now historic ball which was given by Charlotte,
  Duchess of Richmond, wife of Charles, fourth Duke of Richmond
  and Lennox, K.G., who, with their family, had occupied a villa
  in Brussels since the Duke relinquished the Lord-Lieutenancy of
  Ireland in 1813. The Duchess was a daughter, by his beautiful wife,
  Jean, of the fourth Duke of Gordon, known by the Highlanders as
  the "Cock of the North." The daughter of a soldier, the wife of a
  soldier, and the mother of one, her Grace was in close touch with
  the army. In her youth there were few more attractive girls than
  Lady Charlotte Gordon when she used to appear in the feather bonnet
  and Gordon tartan plaid, in compliment to the 92nd Highlanders and
  Gordon Fencibles, which her father had raised.

  The much-talked-of ball took place on the 15th June, 1815, ninety
  years ago yesterday. At three o'clock in the afternoon of that day
  a messenger arrived with important news for the Duke of Wellington
  that Napoleon at the head of his army had crossed the Sambre that
  morning, and had forced the Prussians to retire through Charleroi
  and Fleurus to a position near Ligny. The Duke immediately sent
  off orders for his troops to hold themselves in readiness to move,
  but not to advance. The latter he delayed until the evening,
  when reports from Mons had satisfied him that the attack was not
  a feint, and that Napoleon really had taken the Charleroi road.
  The critical state of affairs did not prevent the Iron Duke from
  attending the ball. On the contrary, he not only went himself, but
  he encouraged his officers to attend, thinking that their presence
  there would have a reassuring effect on the people of Brussels.
  In the room, the coachmaker's store improvised for the occasion,
  were assembled some two hundred guests, including ladies well
  known in English society, and most of the Duke of Wellington's
  staff--the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Brunswick, Lord Hill, Sir
  Thomas Picton, Sir Henry Clinton, the Earl of Uxbridge, Lord Edward
  Somerset, Sir Hussey Vivian, Sir William Ponsonby, Sir Denis Pack,
  and others. The news had spread that the French army was about
  to cross the frontier, and it caused a very natural sensation,
  but the dancing was not interrupted. Indeed, we are told that it
  was maintained with unusual spirit, as if to make the most of the
  enjoyment which was so soon to be interrupted. An interesting
  incident occurred which does not appear to have been recorded.
  During an interval in the dancing, a party of non-commissioned
  officers of the 92nd Highlanders, headed by their pipers, proudly
  marched into the room, having been specially invited to give an
  exhibition of the reel to her Grace's British and foreign guests;
  never did these Gay Gordons dance with greater grace, or to a more
  appreciative audience.

  The imperturbable Duke of Wellington remained at the ball till past
  midnight, constantly receiving messages and giving orders privately
  to the staff. He then quietly withdrew for the desperate encounter
  which was destined to be the crowning scene in a military career
  of unequalled brilliancy. The other officers gradually left the
  room and joined their regiments, many in their dancing pumps. The
  Duchess of Richmond and her daughters took no further part in the
  ball; her husband and two of her sons had accompanied the troops.
  But the girls generally are said to have shown great heartlessness.
  After saying farewell to their partners, many of them for the last
  time, they continued dancing for some hours. Meanwhile, drums,
  bugles, and pipes sounded the assembly through the silent streets;
  the soldiers came swarming out like bees, and Brussels was soon
  astir at the unwonted bustle. What followed is well known. Two days
  later Napoleon's pride was crushed by the most glorious victory
  ever won by British arms; and, alas, the voice of many a gallant
  soldier who, but a few hours before, had been a welcome guest at
  the historic ball in Brussels, was silent in the grave.

  The identity of the famous ball-room in Brussels has been the
  subject of much controversy. For many years it was assumed that the
  house had been pulled down and the ground built over. The villa
  occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Richmond has disappeared in the
  sense that it has been absorbed in the Hospital of the Augustinian
  Sisters; but it was established by the late Sir William Fraser
  to his own and the general satisfaction of the public, that the
  ball was never held in the villa. It took place in the store-room,
  hired for the occasion, of Mons. Simon, the coachmaker, he who
  built the famous carriage which Napoleon used in the campaign.
  It was separate from the villa, and still stands in the Rue de
  la Blanchisserie, in the lower part of the town, being part of
  the building which had returned a few years back to its original
  purpose of a coachmaker's factory and depÃ´t. The room is a long
  barn-like one, with smooth, old-fashioned pillars, and a polished
  floor, and has been likened to the Lower School at Eton under Long
  Chamber--the same square, solid pillars, a low ceiling, and brick,
  whitewashed walls.

The Editor is indebted to Colonel Williams, commanding the Greys, for
the following:--

Major Ker Fox, late 19th Hussars, to Colonel Williams, 14th December,
1905.

  +Dear Sir+,--In looking through some family papers the other day
  I came across the enclosed letter written to an ancestor of mine,
  nearly 150 years ago, by a trooper in the North British Dragoons....

  "Revd. Sir--Experiencing your wellwishes for me when presant &
  Expecting A Continuance of the same emboldens me to send you word
  of my welfare being assured that it will be acceptable. I have long
  since Designed to do what I am now about, That I might be answered
  By the good account that you and all my acquaintances are well. I
  have the greatest reason to bless God that I am still Alive For
  truely Sir since we have been Abroad many have fallen By Death
  some by the fatigues of War & number in ye Field, yet to me has
  the Lord been Sufficient having as yet saved my health & covered
  me from all the Dangers Ive been exposed to. I might here tell you
  of our transactions During this Campaign but being persuaded you
  are no stranger to them I will only say that our Fatigue has been
  great, For ever since the 20th of last March that our Regiment left
  winter quarters we have moved up & down. First from Paderborn to
  Bergen where we fought the French & the Battle being as it were
  Drawn on both sides we could not live there being then no forage
  on the ground & what was in the houses the French had it forraged
  into their Maggazins so that for want of forrage we were forced to
  Leave the Frontiers of the enemy & march for Hess Castle where we
  abode 3 weeks, till the Forrage appear'd in the Field, the French
  came down after us with one Army & Formed another near Lipstadt
  where we open'd the Campaing. It is strange indeed to hear the
  various accounts of the enemy amongst us for the perhaps not 3
  miles Distant from others their Number will by talk Increas or
  decreas 50000 in a Day, here they were given out for 190000 Men
  which I beleve Did not amount to more than 100000. Which was by
  far the supperior Number for ours was never 80000. So that at the
  eve of the Battle & for some weeks before All was Hush non knew
  aney thing till directly put in Execution. So great was the conduct
  of our Brave Prince Ferdinand, Orders for marching on the 1st of
  August was no sooner given than the French began to cannonade the
  Princes Quarters thinking to draw our army there when they would
  have flank'd us. But the Prince Left the Place, & March'd us to
  the Left. That with the Blessing of God altered the whole for they
  were briskly Repulsed & By the same means there great numbers was
  put to a Wofull Flight. It is true the sight and presence of the
  Field is terrable, But the Victory soon Dispell'd it. Altho many
  suffer'd on Both sides, Here the face of affairs were chang'd
  And we are almost so far advanc'd After them as where we fought
  at Bergen. There is scarce a Day but we gain some Advantage over
  them & with Little Loss on our side, so that if God continues his
  Favours on our army the enemy will soon Leave Germany. Marbourg
  surrendered the 1st Days Seige & Never a Man lost on our side.
  About 4 days ago we forc'd the out Posts of their flying Camp &
  got 800 prisoners. We Rejoiced here yesterday for the Good News
  from England & Saxony By fireing all the Cannon & small arms in
  the Field 3 times. The French Ly about 6 miles from us, we march
  foreward the morrow, so that if they dont Abandon their Campment we
  expect another engadgement soon. I have here Dear & Revd Sir I am
  afraid taken to much time in telling you the thing you have long
  since been acquaint with; But I hope you will excuse Me in so Doing
  and Remember me with my comerades at the Throne of Grace, Being
  confident of your care, I pray that God give your endevours the
  Blessing of Turning Many that Dwell in Darkness to Him, And that
  your Reward may be great, is the ernest Prayer Rev. Sir of your
  Most Obedient Servant--+William Knox+ Dragoon.

  "_If you Please Turn oer_

  "I will be obliged greatly if you would Answer this soon Derecting
  to Wm Knox Dragoon in the Royl. North British Dragoons Col.
  Prestons Troop With the Grand Alied Army--Germany. And Remember me
  earnestly to all my Worthy Friends that are your Hearers.

  "_N.B._--I had this By me since the 17th and has had no opertune
  of sending it away before this Date. We are now just by the French
  and its Beleved that we wont seperate Before we engadge again, we
  having been close to them these 7 days. A small River only parts
  us. The French head quarters is at Geeshen and ours at Stroffsdorf.
  Their Campment is strong and ours is the same. We saddle every
  Night & doe not unsadle till we see the enemy's Camp when the fog
  is off in the morning. Our Piquets and advanc'd Posts Lys by theirs
  all night & Returns to Camp when assured they are still.

                                                 25th November, 1906._

  +Dear Colonel Williams+,

  I do not know whether you ever heard of the following, or not--if
  not, then perhaps it may serve its purpose....

  During a big day at Aldershot, "the Greys," one of the cavalry
  regiments engaged, was missed from the scene of action in the Long
  Valley. A.D.C.'s, gallopers, and mounted orderlies were sent all
  over the place to find them.

  The commanding officer had simply dismounted his men, and got them
  into the "Cocked Hat" wood, and told them they might get their
  pipes out and take it easy. When at length found, an A.D.C. rode up
  to the colonel, and said that the general had missed the regiment,
  and was extremely put about in consequence, and told the commanding
  officer that he (the general) wished the regiment to retire behind
  the crest of some rising ground.

  It is reported that the commanding officer at that time, not being
  very good at handling his regiment, thought he saw his way out of
  the difficulty, and with great dignity said, "Young man, go back to
  your general, and tell him that the Greys _never_ retire." ...

                                                   +Montague Johnstone.+

  +My dear Williams+,

  We were on the Curragh ... and next us were the old Gordons.
  We were always pointing out to them that, for Scotchmen in the
  ranks, they could not hold a candle to us. One day some of them
  came to us, and told us they had a batch of recruits coming,
  real Highlanders, such as we had not, "none of 'em had seen the
  English," and the band and pipes had gone to Newbridge to "march
  'em up." So down we all went to the outlet of the Newbridge road
  to see the arrival on the Curragh. Sure enough, soon we heard the
  pipes and saw the sporrans swinging, always a glorious sight! and
  on the boys came, straight from their mountains and glens. But,
  alas! as they passed us and came in full view of the Curragh, a
  young recruit in the ranks turned to his comrade and said, "Why,
  bust me, Billy, if this ain't Putney 'Eath without the pubs."
  Tableau! and triumphal march home of the old Greys.

  At the same period as this, one night the old Gordons poured
  through windows and doors into our mess and fairly wrecked us. So
  we joined forces and went for the 9th Lancers together in the same
  fashion. When all was smashed, all lights out, and everybody was
  leaning up against walls in torn and tattered mess uniform trying
  to get breath, in came a frightened mess waiter with a candle stuck
  in a ginger-beer bottle. This revealed a tablecloth on the floor
  still heaving up and down, the last struggle of a glorious fight.
  This was slipped away, and underneath was found the Junior Sub. of
  the Gordons tightly gripping the Colonel of the 9th Lancers by the
  throat--the chief nearly black in the face. But a more good-natured
  man never lived. He made it a subject of chaff, and a bond between
  all three regiments was thereby forged which I know will never be
  broken....

                                                        +J. A. Torrens.+

  At Dundalk in 1868 during a good run with the Regimental Drag
  Hounds, a grey horse, Barabbas, owned and ridden by Lieutenant
  Bashford, pounded the field over a very boggy brook. At dinner
  the same evening, while discussing the extraordinary cleverness
  of the horse (after clearing the brook a native having roared out
  "Begorra, he changed on a trout"!), Mr. Wilkinson, the resident
  magistrate of Castle Bellingham, made a bet of Â£25 that Barabbas
  could not jump the mess-room table. The bet was at once accepted,
  and Mr. Bashford getting permission of the Colonel, went straight
  off to the stable, put on the saddle and bridle, and brought the
  horse into the mess-room. Captain Hicks, the paymaster, jumped on
  his back, and in a second had cleared the table.

  _Scene_--+The Crimea+, two or three days before the charge of
  Balaclava. The Scots Greys are mounted and drawn up in line behind
  a hill waiting for orders. Lieut.-Colonel Darby Griffiths is
  sitting on his horse in front of the centre of the line. To him
  comes a young and very excited staff officer at full gallop, who
  says: "Colonel, ten men who dare go anywhere and know no fear
  are wanted at once. They must be desperate fellows, as they have
  a desperate job to perform. Please let me have them as soon as
  possible." Old Darby Griffiths, scarcely turning in his saddle, and
  without a moment's hesitation: "Greys, from your right number off
  ten!"

                                                                   H. S.

                             THE LOST DUCKS

  Some years ago a famous and historic cavalry regiment was moving
  from England to Ireland, marching by detachments, mostly of a
  troop each, to embark at Liverpool. These were billeted at nights
  in some town, foot and horse billets often widely scattered, and
  sometimes far separated one from the other. In the mornings, at the
  time appointed for marching away, all assembled at the rendezvous,
  usually the market-place, or a main street near the hotel where
  the officers were quartered. There a dense crowd watched the
  parade, the inspection, and the march off. On a certain occasion,
  the captain of C Troop, just before turning out, was interviewed
  by an angry, excited inn-keeper, who declared that the troopers
  billeted on him had stolen two of his fine, fat, white ducks. The
  captain assured him he must be mistaken, but that every means would
  be taken, if it were so, to detect and punish the culprits, and
  promised compensation. Owing to the great crowd round the parade,
  nothing could be done until clear of the town. On these marches,
  when horses were liable to sore backs and rubs from careless
  saddling, packing kit, girthing, etc., it was usual, after a trot,
  to halt a mile or so away from the billets, dismount, and carefully
  examine each horse and its equipment. On this occasion, the captain
  ordered kits to be unpacked, cloaks to be unrolled sufficiently to
  prevent the possibility of ducks being concealed in them. He then
  rode round the ranks drawn up on both sides of the road, and made
  a careful inspection. It revealed not even a feather of the ducks.
  From the next town he wrote to the aggrieved complainant, proving
  him to have been mistaken, and saying that such a charge should not
  have been brought against his men, who were incapable of stealing.

  It was some years before the truth became known to the captain.
  In those days, officers on the line of march sent their light
  baggage by train with their servants, and carried nothing on their
  horses except brushes and stable rubbers for smartening up before
  entering a town, but they were ordered to carry behind the saddle
  a long-shaped valise, supposed to hold the kit, but usually filled
  with hay or straw to prevent rubbing the horse's back.

  On that day the missing ducks were packed away in the captain's
  valise, and during his inspection and the whole of the day's march,
  he carried behind him the theft he was seeking to discover.

                                                       +A. C. E. Welby.+

The following by very kind leave of the author, an old officer of the
Greys:--

                        THE BONNIE SCOTS GREYS.

                      (_Air_--"+Bonnie Dundee.+")

    Come Highland, come Lowland, lend ear to the praise
    Of the bravest of horsemen, your own gallant Greys;
    Ye Scots far away from your native land, come,
    Hear the fame of the Jocks, ever "Second to none."

        Come, Scots, drink a health to your "Second to none";
        To your own bonnie Greys, to their victories won;
        Come, drink to the luck of your Jocks, one and all,
        Wherever their trumpet of duty may call.

    O, see the grey horses come stepping along,
    So proud in their glory, so famous in song;
    Black bonnets of bearskin; O, where are the peers
    Of the men on grey horses, the Scots Grenadiers?

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    Their deeds are enshrined in the annals of war;
    They have rode down the French, times a hundred and a',
    And of standards and colours have ta'en such a store,
    Not a corps in the world that has ever won more.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    Many hundreds of French they at Blenheim did chase,
    Penned them back in the village and made to cry grace;
    Then at Ramillies captured the Corps of the King
    And of standards a score with them homeward did bring.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    See the white broider'd flag of the Household of France,
    Like its thunderbolt emblem, at Dettingen glance;
    "The giants have felt it," true motto that day,
    When the hands of the Scotsmen had borne it away.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    Now fill a full glass to the old ninety-twa,
    So leal in their friendship, so gallant in war,
    With a "Scotland for ever," the Waterloo shout,
    When the Greys and the Gordons drove Frenchmen to rout.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    "Ah, the beautiful Greys, I must crush them, I ween";
    But the Greys reached the hill where Napoleon had been,
    While the brave Sergeant Ewart an Eagle has ta'en,
    And the Union Brigade gathered laurels of fame.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    Balaclava resounds with the shouts of the Greys;
    All the horsemen of Russia stand still with amaze;
    Each Grey hews a path through the dense-crowded horde,
    And the Russians spur homeward with willing accord.

                                  Come, Scots, drink a health, etc.

    Their deeds were their duty to Scotland, and a';
    Should the trumpet again sound the charge in a war,
    Not a Russian or Frenchman will e're dare to stay,
    When they hear the wild war shout of "Scotland for aye."

        Come, Scots, drink a health to your "Second to none";
        To your own bonnie Greys, to their victories won;
        Come, drink to the luck of your Jocks, one and all,
        Wherever their trumpet of duty may call.

                                                   +Alfred C. E. Welby.+

On the eastern wall of the north transept of Norwich Cathedral is a
memorial tablet as follows:--

                           To the memory of
           +Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Thomas Pate Hankin, Kt.+,
                          who died at Norwich
                          October 26th, 1825,
                     in the 60th year of his age.
          This tablet is placed here as a tribute of respect
                                by the
                  Officers of the Royal Scots Greys,
   in which regiment he had passed the greater part of his life, and
                             commanded it
                       at the time of his death.

Extract from letter by the Honourable Charles Hamilton to his brother,
George Baillie, during the Westphalian campaign. The original letter
belongs to Lord Binning, who allowed his cousin, Captain Lindsay,
to have this extract carefully made for him by the Honourable Hen.
Dalrymple, brother of the Earl of Stair.

  _Buna Camp, Aug. 28th, 1760._

  The Army stays where it was at Warburg. The Duke changed his
  quarters to Bunay a few days ago, it is about eight miles from
  Warburg. We are to march this day. The French marched from ground
  some time ago towards Cassel. The Hereditary Prince attacked their
  rearguard, the Grays & Inniskillings attacked some Cavalry, they
  were the only British Cavalry with the Prince, & tore them like
  pork & made dogs of them. In the persuit they were saluted with a
  fire from some infantry that killed several & wounded a good many.
  Col. Preston had his horse killed upon a bridge both he and his
  horse fell over, he was a good deal bruised.


                     NOTES ON CREICHTOUN'S MEMOIRS

               (_Kindly supplied by J. B. Dalzell, Esq._)

Creichtoun says:--

1. _He_ commanded at Ayrsmoss. (Bruce of Earlshall did.) "The Royalists
killed about sixty and took fourteen prisoners." (Nine only were killed
and five taken prisoners.)

2. The "rebels" at Drumclog were "eight or nine thousand strong."
(There were only 250 in all.)

3. Sir Robert Hamilton, who commanded at Drumclog was "a profligate who
had spent all his patrimony." (The evidence of the historian, Bishop
Barnet, and of other reputable authorities, is all the other way.)

4. The number of the "rebels" at Bothwell Bridge was 14,000, and the
bridge was "guarded with three thousand of the rebels." (Three thousand
is nearer the mark, with only two or three hundred guarding the bridge.)

5. The "rebels had set up a very large gallows in the middle of their
camp, and prepared a cartful of new ropes at the foot of it in order to
hang the king's soldiers." (This gallows was simply the usual permanent
gallows of the Sheriff Court of Lanarkshire Netherward.)

6. David Steele was dispatched by swords _in his absence_. (Steele
surrendered under promise of quarter and a fair trial. But Creichtoun
conveyed him to Steele's house, nearly a mile, and there in the
presence of the man's wife and her little babe, Mary Steele, ordered
the dragoons to shoot him. To their credit, the dragoons absolutely
refused and rode off, but the Highlanders, who probably knew Gaelic
only, and were therefore ignorant of Creichtoun's gross breach of
faith, fired.)

These six instances are but a sample of the exaggeration and mendacious
inventions only too common throughout Creichtoun's memoirs, and the
reader would therefore do well to hesitate before accepting what is not
corroborated by independent evidence.


                        NOTE ON GENERAL DALYELL

Immediately after the death of General Dalyell, his eldest son Thomas
was created a baronet of Nova Scotia. Considerably over one hundred
varieties in spelling this curious ancient Scottish surname have been
collected. The General and his father, the Sheriff of Linlithgowshire,
uniformly spelt their surname Dalyell, as their descendants are in the
habit of doing at the present day.

                                                          J. B. DALZELL.

been omitted. Owing to the great mass of names dealt with, it has
not been practicable to follow the fortunes of each individual. All
identical names, therefore, have been indexed under a single entry, and
